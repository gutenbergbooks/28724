<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<h3>ALONG THE NORTH DEVON COAST.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="98" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><div class='unindent'>T was a morning of late May, and the
sunshine, though rather watery, after
the fashion of South-of-England suns,
was real sunshine still, and glinted and glittered
bravely on the dew-soaked fields about
Copplestone Grange.</div>

<p>This was an ancient house of red brick,
dating back to the last half of the sixteenth
century, and still bearing testimony in its
sturdy bulk to the honest and durable work
put upon it by its builders. Not a joist had
bent, not a girder started in the long course
of its two hundred and odd years of life. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
brick-work of its twisted chimney-stacks was
intact, and the stone carving over its doorways
and window frames; only the immense
growth of the ivy on its side walls attested
to its age. It takes longer to build ivy five
feet thick than many castles, and though new
masonry by trick and artifice may be made
to look like old, there is no secret known
to man by which a plant or tree can be induced
to simulate an antiquity which does
not rightfully belong to it. Innumerable
sparrows and tomtits had built in the thick
mats of the old ivy, and their cries and twitters
blended in shrill and happy chorus as
they flew in and out of their nests.</p>

<p>The Grange had been a place of importance,
in Queen Elizabeth's time, as the home
of an old Devon family which was finally run
out and extinguished. It was now little more
than a superior sort of farm-house. The
broad acres of meadow and pleasaunce and
woodland which had given it consequence in
former days had been gradually parted with,
as misfortunes and losses came to its original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
owners. The woods had been felled, the
pleasure grounds now made part of other
people's farms, and the once wide domain had
contracted, until the ancient house stood with
only a few acres about it, and wore something
the air of an old-time belle who has been
forcibly divested of her ample farthingale and
hooped-petticoat, and made to wear the scant
kirtle of a village maid.</p>

<p>Orchards of pear and apple flanked the
building to east and west. Behind was a
field or two crowning a little upland where
sedate cows fed demurely; and in front, toward
the south, which was the side of entrance,
lay a narrow walled garden, with
box-bordered beds full of early flowers, mimulus,
sweet-peas, mignonette, stock gillies,
and blush and damask roses, carefully tended
and making a blaze of color on the face of
the bright morning. The whole front of
the house was draped with a luxuriant vine
of Gloire de Dijon, whose long, pink-yellow
buds and cream-flushed cups sent wafts of
delicate sweetness with every puff of wind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Seventy years before the May morning of
which we write, Copplestone Grange had
fallen at public sale to Edward Young, a
well-to-do banker of Bideford. He was a descendant
in direct line of that valiant Young
who, together with his fellow-seaman Prowse,
undertook the dangerous task of steering
down and igniting the seven fire-ships which
sent the Spanish armada "lumbering off" to
sea, and saved England for Queen Elizabeth
and the Protestant succession.</p>

<p>Edward Young lived twenty years in
peace and honor to enjoy his purchase, and
his oldest son James now reigned in his stead,
having reared within the old walls a numerous
brood of sons and daughters, now scattered
over the surface of the world in general,
after the sturdy British fashion, till only three
or four remained at home, waiting their turn
to fly.</p>

<p>One of these now stood at the gate. It
was Imogen Young, oldest but one of the
four daughters. She was evidently waiting
for some one, and waiting rather impatiently.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>"We shall certainly be late," she said
aloud, "and it's quite too bad of Lion."
Then, glancing at the little silver watch in
her belt, she began to call, "Lion! Lionel!
Oh, Lion! do make haste! It's gone twenty
past, and we shall never be there in time."</p>

<p>"Coming," shouted a voice from an upper
window; "I'm just washing my hands. Coming
in a jiffy, Moggy."</p>

<p>"Jiffy!" murmured Imogen. "How very
American Lion has got to be. He's always
'guessing' and 'calculating' and 'reckoning.'
It seems as if he did it on purpose
to startle and annoy me. I suppose one
has got to get used to it if you're over there,
but really it's beastly bad form, and I shall
keep on telling Lion so."</p>

<p>She was not a pretty girl, but neither was
she an ill-looking one. Neither tall nor very
slender, her vigorous little figure had still a
certain charm of trim erectness and youthful
grace, though Imogen was twenty-four,
and considered herself very staid and grown-up.
A fresh, rosy skin, beautiful hair of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
warm, chestnut color, with a natural wave in
it, and clear, honest, blue eyes, went far to
atone for a thick nose, a wide mouth, and
front teeth which projected slightly and
seemed a size too large for the face to which
they belonged. Her dress did nothing to
assist her looks. It was woollen, of an unbecoming
shade of yellowish gray; it fitted badly,
and the complicated loops and hitches of the
skirt bespoke a fashion some time since passed
by among those who were particular as to
such matters. The effect was not assisted by
a pork-pie hat of black straw trimmed with
green feathers, a pink ribbon from which
depended a silver locket, a belt of deep
magenta-red, yellow gloves, and an umbrella
bright navy-blue in tint. She had over her
arm a purplish water-proof, and her thick,
solid boots could defy the mud of her native
shire.</p>

<p>"Lion! Lion!" she called again; and this
time a tall young fellow responded, running
rapidly down the path to join her. He was
two years her junior, vigorous, alert, and boyish,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with a fresh skin, and tawny, waving hair
like her own.</p>

<p>"How long you have been!" she cried
reproachfully.</p>

<p>"Grieved to have kept you, Miss," was the
reply. "You see, things went contrairy-like.
The grease got all over me when I was cleaning
the guns, and cold water wouldn't take
it off, and that old Saunders took his time
about bringing the can of hot, till at last I
rushed down and fetched it up myself from
the copper. You should have seen cook's
face! 'Fancy, Master Lionel,' says she,
'coming yourself for 'ot water!' I tell you,
Moggy, Saunders is past his usefulness.
He's a regular duffer&mdash;a gump."</p>

<p>"There's another American expression.
Saunders is a most respectable man, I'm sure,
and has been in the family thirty-one years.
Of course he has a good deal to do just now,
with the packing and all. Now, Lion, we
shall have to walk smartly if we're to get
there at half-after."</p>

<p>"All right. Here goes for a spin, then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The brother and sister walked rapidly on
down the winding road, in the half-shadow
of the bordering hedges. Real Devonshire
hedge-rows they were, than which are none
lovelier in England, rising eight and ten feet
overhead on either side, and topped with delicate,
flickering birch and ash boughs blowing
in the fresh wind. Below were thick growths
of hawthorn, white and pink, and wild white
roses in full flower interspersed with maple
tips as red as blood, the whole interlaced and
held together with thick withes and tangles
of ivy, briony, and travellers' joy. Beneath
them the ground was strewn with flowers,&mdash;violets,
and king-cups, poppies, red campions,
and blue iris,&mdash;while tall spikes of rose-colored
foxgloves rose from among ranks of
massed ferns, brake, hart's-tongue, and maiden's-hair,
with here and there a splendid
growth of Osmund Royal. To sight and smell,
the hedge-rows were equally delightful.</p>

<p>Copplestone Grange stood three miles west
of Bideford, and the house to which the
Youngs were going was close above Clovelly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
so that a distance of some seven miles separated
them. To walk this twice for the sake
of lunching with a friend would seem to
most young Americans too formidable a task
to be at all worth while, but to our sturdy
English pair it presented no difficulties. On
they went, lightly and steadily, Imogen's
elastic steps keeping pace easily with her
brother's longer tread. There was a good
deal of up and down hill to get over with,
and whenever they topped a rise, green downs
ending in wooded cliffs could be seen to the
left, and beyond and below an expanse of
white-flecked shimmering sea. A salt wind
from the channel blew in their faces, full of
coolness and refreshment, and there was no
dust.</p>

<p>"I suppose we shall never see the ocean
from where we are to live," said Imogen,
with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Well, hardly, considering it's about fifteen-hundred
miles away."</p>

<p>"Fifteen hundred! oh, Lion, you are surely
exaggerating. Why, the whole of England<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
is not so large as that, from Land's End to
John O'Groat's House."</p>

<p>"I should say not, nothing like it. Why
Moggy, you've no idea how small our 'right
little, tight little island' really is. You could
set it down plump in some of the States,
New York, for instance, and there would be
quite a tidy fringe of territory left all round
it. Of course, morally, we are the standard
of size for all the world, but geographically,
phew!&mdash;our size is little, though our
hearts are great."</p>

<p>"I think it's vulgar to be so big,&mdash;not that
I believe half you say, Lion. You've been
over in America so long, and grown such a
Yankee, that you swallow everything they
choose to tell you. I've always heard about
American brag&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My dear, there's no need to brag when
the facts are there, staring you in the face.
It's just a matter of feet and inches,&mdash;any
one can do the measurement who has a tape-line.
Wait till you see it. And as for its
being vulgar to be big, why is the 'right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
little, tight little' always stretching out her
long arms to rope in new territory, in that
case, I should like to know? It would be
much eleganter to keep herself to home&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, don't talk that sort of rot; I hate to
hear you."</p>

<p>"I must when you talk that kind of&mdash;well,
let us say 'rubbish.' 'Rot' is one of our
choice terms which hasn't got over to the
States yet. You're as opiniated and 'narrer'
as the little island itself. What do
you know about America, any way? Did
you ever see an American in your life,
child?"</p>

<p>"Yes, several. I saw Buffalo Bill last year,
and lots of Indians and cow-boys whom he
had fetched over. And I saw Professor&mdash;Professor&mdash;what
was his name? I forget, but
he lectured on phrenology; and then there
was Mrs. Geoff Templestowe."</p>

<p>"Oh Mrs. Geoff&mdash;she's a different sort.
Buffalo Bill and his show can hardly be
treated as specimens of American society,
and neither can your bump-man. But she's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a fair sample of the nice kind; and you liked
her, now didn't you? you know you did."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I did," admitted Imogen, rather
grudgingly. "She was really quite nice,
and good-form, and all that, and Isabel
said she was far and away the best sister-in-law
yet, and the Squire took such a fancy
to her that it was quite remarkable. But she
cannot be used as an argument, for she's
not the least like the American girls in the
books. She must have had unusual
advantages. And after all,&mdash;nice as she was, she
wasn't English. There was a difference somehow,&mdash;you
felt it though you couldn't say
exactly what it was."</p>

<p>"No, thank goodness&mdash;she isn't; that's
just the beauty of it. Why should all the
world be just alike? And what books do
you mean, and what girls? There are all
kinds on the other side, I can tell you. Wait
till you get over to the High Valley and
you'll see."</p>

<p>This sort of discussion had become habitual
of late between the brother and sister. Three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
years before, Lionel had gone out to Colorado,
to "look about and see how ranching suited
him," as he phrased it, and had decided that
it suited him exactly. He had served a sort
of apprenticeship to Geoffrey Templestowe,
the son of an old Devonshire neighbor, who
had settled in a place called High Valley,
and, together with two partners, had built up
a flourishing and lucrative cattle business, owning
a large tract of grazing territory and great
herds. One of the partners was now transferred
to New Mexico, where the firm owned
land also, and Mr. Young had advanced
money to buy Lionel, who was now competent
to begin for himself, a share in the business.
He was now going out to remain permanently,
and Imogen was going also, to keep
his house and make a home for him till he
should be ready to marry and settle down.</p>

<p>All over the world there are good English
sisters doing this sort of thing. In Australia
and New Zealand they are to be found, in
Canada, and India, and the Transvaal,&mdash;wherever
English boys are sent to advance their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
fortunes. Had her destination been Canada
or Australia, Imogen would have found no
difficulty in adjusting her ideas to it, but the
United States were a <i>terra incognita</i>. Knowing
absolutely nothing about them, she had
constructed out of a fertile fancy and a few
facts an altogether imaginary America, not
at all like the real one; peopled by strange
folk quite un-English in their ideas and ways,
and very hard to understand and live with.
In vain did Lionel protest and explain; his
remonstrances were treated as proofs of the
degeneracy and blindness induced by life in
"The States," and to all his appeals she opposed
that calm, obstinate disbelief which is
the weapon of a limited intellect and experience,
and is harder to deal with than the most
passionate convictions.</p>

<p>Unknown to herself a little sting of underlying
jealousy tinctured these opinions. For
many years Isabel Templestowe had been her
favorite friend, the person she most admired
and looked up to. They had been at school
together,&mdash;Isabel always taking the lead in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
everything, Imogen following and imitating.
The Templestowes were better born than the
Youngs, they took a higher place in the county;
it was a distinction as well as a tender
pleasure to be intimate in the house. Once
or twice Isabel had gone to her married sister
in London for a taste of the "season."
No such chance had ever fallen to Imogen's
lot, but it was next best to get letters, and
hear from Isabel of all that she had seen and
done; thus sharing the joys at second-hand,
as it were.</p>

<p>Isabel had other intimates, some of whom
were more to her than Imogen could be,
but they lived at a distance and Imogen
close at hand. Propinquity plays a large
part in friendship as well as love. Imogen
had no other intimate, but she knew too
little of Isabel's other interests to be made
uncomfortable about them, and was quite
happy in her position as nearest and closest
confidante until, four years before, Geoffrey
Templestowe came home for a visit, bringing
with him his American wife, whose name<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
before her marriage had been Clover Carr,
and whom some of you who read this will
recognize as an old friend.</p>

<p>Young, sweet, pretty, very happy, and
"horribly well-dressed," as poor Imogen in
her secret soul admitted, Clover easily and
quickly won the liking of her "people-in-law."
All the outlying sons and daughters
who were within reach came home to make
her acquaintance, and all were charmed with
her. The Squire petted and made much of
his new daughter and could not say enough
in her praise. Mrs. Templestowe averred that
she was as good as she was pretty, and as "sensible"
as if she had been born and brought
up in England; and, worst of all, Isabel, for
the time of their stay, was perfectly absorbed
in Geoff and Clover, and though kind and
affectionate when they met, had little or no
time to spend on Imogen. She and Clover
were of nearly the same age, each had a thousand
interesting things to tell the other, both
were devoted to Geoffrey,&mdash;it was natural,
inevitable, that they should draw together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
Imogen confessed to herself that it was only
right that they should do so, but it hurt all
the same, and it was still a sore spot in her
heart that Isabel should love Clover so much,
and that they should write such long letters
to each other. She was a conscientious girl,
and she fought against the feeling and tried
hard to forget it, but there it was all the
same.</p>

<p>But while I have been explaining, the rapid
feet of the two walkers had taken them past
the Hoops Inn, and to the opening of a rough
shady lane which made a short cut to the
grounds of Stowe Manor, as the Templestowes'
place was called.</p>

<p>They entered by a private gate, opened by
Imogen with a key which she carried, and
found themselves on the slope of a hill overhung
with magnificent old beeches. Farther
down, the slope became steeper and narrowed
to form the sharp "chine" which cut the
cliff seaward to the water's edge. The Manor-house
stood on a natural plateau at the head
of the ravine, whose steep green sides made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
frame for the beautiful picture it commanded
of Lundy Island, rising in bold outlines over
seventeen miles of blue, tossing sea.</p>

<p>The brother and sister paused a moment
to look for the hundredth time at this exquisite
glimpse. Then they ran lightly down
over the grass to where an intersecting gravel-path
led to the door. It stood hospitably
open, affording a view of the entrance hall.</p>

<p>Such a beautiful old hall! built in the time
of the Tudors, with a great carven fireplace,
mullioned windows in deep square bays, and
a ceiling carved with fans, shields, and roses.
"Bow-pots" stood on the sills, full of rose-leaves
and spices, huge antlers and trophies
of weapons adorned the walls, and the polished
floor, almost black with age, shone like
a looking-glass.</p>

<p>Beyond opened a drawing-room, low-ceiled
and equally quaint in build. The furniture
seemed as old as the house. There was
nothing with a modern air about it, except
some Indian curiosities, a water-color or two,
the photographs of the family, and the fresh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
flowers in the vases. But the sun shone in,
there was a great sense of peace and stillness,
and beside a little wood-fire, which burned
gently and did not hiss or crackle as it
might have done elsewhere, sat a lovely old
lady, whose fresh and peaceful and kindly
face seemed the centre from which all the
home look and comfort streamed. She was
knitting a long silk stocking, a volume of
Mudie's lay on her knee, and a skye terrier,
blue, fuzzy, and sleepy, had curled himself
luxuriously in the folds of her dress.</p>

<p>This was Mrs. Templestowe, Geoff's mother
and Clover's mother-in-law. She jumped up
almost as lightly as a girl to welcome the
visitors.</p>

<p>"Take your hat off, my dear," she said to
Imogen, "or would you rather run up to Isabel's
room? She was here just now, but her
father called her off to consult about something
in the hot-house. He won't keep her
long&mdash; Ah, there she is now," as a figure
flashed by the window; "I knew she would
be here directly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Another second and Isabel hurried in, a tall,
slender girl with thick, fair hair, blue eyes
with dark lashes, and a look of breeding and
distinction. Her dress, very simple in cut,
suited her, and had that undefinable air of
being just right which a good London tailor
knows how to give. She wore no ornaments,
but Imogen, who had felt rather well-dressed
when she left home, suddenly hated her
gown and hat, realized that her belt and ribbon
did not agree, and wished for the dozenth
time that she had the knack at getting the
right thing which Isabel possessed.</p>

<p>"Her clothes grow prettier all the time,
and mine get uglier," she reflected. "The
Squire says she got points from Mrs. Geoff,
and that the Americans know how to dress
if they don't know anything else; but that's
nonsense, of course,&mdash;Isabel always did know
how; she didn't need any one to teach her."</p>

<p>Pretty soon they were all seated at luncheon,
a hearty and substantial meal, as befitted
the needs of people who had just taken
a seven-mile walk. A great round of cold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
beef stood at one end of the table, a chicken-pie
at the other, and there were early peas
and potatoes, a huge cherry-tart, a "junket"
equally large, strawberries, and various cakes
and pastries, meant to be eaten with a smother
of that delicacy peculiar to Devonshire, clotted
cream. Every body was very hungry, and
not much was said till the first rage of appetite
was satisfied.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the Squire, as he filled his
glass with amber-hued cider,&mdash;"you don't
get anything so good as this to drink over in
America, Lionel."</p>

<p>"Indeed we do, sir. Wait till you taste
our lemonade made with natural soda-water."</p>

<p>"Lemonade? phoo! Poor stuff I call it,
cold and thin. I hope Geoff has some better
tipple than that to cheer him in the High
Valley."</p>

<p>"Iced water," suggested Lionel, mischievously.</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me about iced water. It's
worse than lemonade. It's the perpetual
use of ice which makes the Americans so
nervous, I am convinced."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, papa, are they so nervous? Clover
certainly isn't."</p>

<p>"Ah! my little Clover,&mdash;no, she wasn't
nervous. She was nothing that she ought
not to be. I call her as sweet a lass as any
country need want to see. But Clover's no
example; there aren't many like her, I fancy,&mdash;eh,
Lion?"</p>

<p>"Well, Squire, she's not the only one of
the sort over there. Her sister, who married
Mr. Page, our other partner, you know, is
quite as pretty as she is, and as nice, too,
though in a different way. And there's the
oldest one&mdash;the wife of the naval officer,
I'm not sure but you would like her the best
of the three. She's a ripper in looks,&mdash;tall,
you know, with lots of go and energy, and
yet as sweet and womanly as can be; you'd
like her very much, you'd like all of them."</p>

<p>"How is the unmarried one?&mdash;Joan, I think
they call her," asked Mrs. Templestowe.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Lionel, rather confused, "I
don't know so much about her. She's only
once been out to the valley since I was there.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
She seems a nice girl, and certainly she's
mighty pretty."</p>

<p>"Lion's blushing," remarked Imogen.
"He always does blush when he speaks of
that Miss Carr."</p>

<p>"Rot!" muttered Lionel, with a wrathful
look at his sister. "I do nothing of the
kind. But, Squire, when are you coming
over to see for yourself how we look and
behave? I think you and the Madam would
enjoy a summer in the High Valley very
much, and it would be no end of larks to
have you. Isabel would like it of all things."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know I should. I would start to-morrow,
if I could. I'm coming across to make
Clover and Imogen a long visit the first moment
that papa and mamma can spare me."</p>

<p>"That will be a long time to wait, I fear,"
said her mother, sadly. "Since Mr. Matthewson
married and carried off poor Helen's
children, the house has seemed so silent that
except for you it would hardly be worth while
to get up in the morning. We can't spare
you at present, dear child."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"I know, mamma, and I shall never go till
you can. The perfect thing would be that
we should all go together."</p>

<p>"Yes, if it were not for that dreadful
voyage."</p>

<p>"Oh, the voyage is nothing," broke in the
irrepressible Lionel, "you just take some little
pills; I forget the name of them, but they
make you safe not to be sick, and then you're
across before you know it. The ships are
very comfortable,&mdash;electric bells, Welsh rabbits
at bed-time, and all that, you know."</p>

<p>"Fancy mamma with a Welsh rabbit at
bed-time!&mdash;mamma, who cannot even row
down to Gallantry on the smoothest day
without being upset! You must bait your
hook with something else, Lionel, if you
hope to catch her."</p>

<p>"How would a trefoil of clover-leaves answer?"
with a smile,&mdash;"she, Geoff, and the
boy."</p>

<p>"Ah, that dear baby. I wish I <i>could</i> see
the little fellow. He is so pretty in his picture,"
sighed Mrs. Templestowe. "That bait<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
would land me if anything could, Lion. By
the way, there are some little parcels for
them, which I thought perhaps you would
make room for, Imogen."</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, I'll carry anything with
pleasure. Now I'm afraid we must be going.
Mother wants me to step down to Clovelly
with a message for the landlady of the New
Inn, and I've set my heart upon walking
once more to Gallantry Bower. Can't you
come with us, Isabel? It would be so nice
if you could, and it's my last chance."</p>

<p>"Of course I will. I'll be ready in five
minutes, if you really can't stay any longer."</p>

<p>The three friends were soon on their way,
under a low-hung sky, which looked near
and threatening. The beautiful morning
was fled.</p>

<p>"We had better cut down into the Hobby
grounds and get under the trees, for I think
it's going to be wet," said Imogen.</p>

<p>The suggestion proved a wise one, for before
they emerged from the shelter of the
woods it was raining smartly, and the girls<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
were glad of their water-proofs and umbrellas.
Lionel, with hands in pockets, strode on,
disdaining what he was pleased to call "a
little local shower."</p>

<p>"You should see how it pours in Colorado,"
he remarked. "That's worth calling
rain! Immense! Noah would feel perfectly
at home in it!"</p>

<p>The tax of threepence each person, by
which strangers are ingeniously made to
contribute to the "local charities," was not
exacted of them at the New Road Gate, on
the strength of their being residents, and
personal friends of the owners of Clovelly
Court. A few steps farther brought them
to the top of a zig-zag path, sloping sharply
downward at an angle of some sixty-five
degrees, paved with broad stones, and flanked
on either side by houses, no two of which
occupied the same level, and which seemed
to realize their precarious footing, and hug
the rift in which they were planted as limpets
hug a rock.</p>

<p>This was the so-called "Clovelly Street,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and surely a more extraordinary thing in the
way of a street does not exist in the known
world. The little village is built on the sides
of a crack in a tremendous cliff; the "street"
is merely the bottom of the crack, into which
the ingenuity of man has fitted a few stones,
set slant-wise, with intersecting ridges on
which the foot can catch as it goes slipping
hopelessly down. Even to practised walkers
the descent is difficult, especially when the
stones are wet. The party from Stowe were
familiar with the path, and had trodden it
many times, but even they picked their steps,
and went "delicately" like King Agag, holding
up umbrellas in one hand, and with the
other catching at garden palings and the
edges of door-steps to save themselves from
pitching headlong, while beside them little
boys and girls with the agility of long practice,
went down merrily almost at a run, their
heavy, flat-bottomed shoes making a clap-clap-clapping
noise as they descended, like
the strokes of a mallet on wood.</p>

<p>Looking up and above the quaint tenements<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that bordered the "street," other houses
equally quaint could be seen on either side
rising above each other to the top of the
cliff, in whose midst the crack which held
the village is set. How it ever entered into
the mind of man to utilize such a place for
such a purpose it was hard to conceive. The
eccentricity of level was endless, gardens
topped roofs, gooseberry-bushes and plum-trees
seemed growing out of chimneys, tall
trees rose apparently from ridge-poles, and
here and there against the sky appeared extraordinary
wooden figures of colossal size,
Mermaids and Britannias and Belle Savages,
figure-heads of forgotten ships which old sea-captains
out of commission had set up in their
gardens to remind them of perils past. The
weather-beaten little houses looked centuries
old, and all had such an air of having been
washed accidentally into their places by a
great tidal wave that the vines and flowers
which overhung them affected the new-comer
with a sense of surprise.</p>

<p>Down went the three, slipping and sliding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
catching on and recovering themselves, till
they came to a small, low-browed building
dating back for a couple of centuries or so,
which was the "New Inn." "Old" and "new"
have a local meaning of their own in Clovelly
which does not exactly apply anywhere
else.</p>

<p>Up two little steps they passed into a narrow
entry, with a parlor on one side and on
the other a comfortable sort of housekeeper's
room, where a fire was blazing in a grate with
wide hobs. Both rooms as well as the entry
were hung with plates, dishes, platters, and
bowls, set thickly on the walls in groups of
tens and scores and double-scores, as suited
their shape and color. The same ceramic
decoration ran upstairs and pervaded the
rooms above more or less; a more modern
brick-building on the opposite side of the street
which was the "annex" of the Inn, was
equally full; hundreds and hundreds of
plates and saucers and cups, English and
Delft ware chiefly, and blue and white in
color. It had been the landlady's hobby for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
years past to form this collection of china,
and it was now for sale to any one who
might care to buy.</p>

<p>Isabel and Lionel ran to and fro examining
"the great wall of China," as he termed it,
while Imogen did her mother's errand to the
landlady. Then they started again to mount
the hill, which was an easier task than going
down, passing on the way two or three parties
of tourists holding on to each other, and
shrieking and exclaiming; and being passed
by a minute donkey with two sole-leather
trunks slung on one side of him, and on the
other a mountainous heap of hand-bags and
valises. This is the only creature with four
legs, bigger than a dog, that ever gets down
the Clovelly street; and why he does not lose
his balance, topple backward, and go rolling
continuously down till he falls into the sea
below, nobody can imagine. But the valiant
little animal kept steadily on, assisted
by his owner, who followed and assiduously
whacked him with a stout stick, and he reached
the top much sooner than any of his biped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
following. One cannot have too many legs
in Clovelly,&mdash;a centipede would find himself
at an uncommon advantage.</p>

<p>At the top of the street is the "Yellery
Gate" through which our party passed into
lovely park grounds topping a line of fine
cliffs which lead to "Gallantry Bower." This
is the name given to an enormous headland
which falls into the sea with a sheer descent
of nearly four hundred feet, and forms the
western boundary of the Clovelly roadstead.</p>

<p>The path was charmingly laid out with
belts of woodland and clumps of flowering
shrubs. Here and there was a seat or a rustic
summer-house, commanding views of the
sea, now a deep intense blue, for the rain
had ceased as suddenly as it came, and broad
yellow rays were streaming over the wet grass
and trees, whose green was dazzling in its
freshness. Imogen drew in a long breath of
the salt wind, and looked wistfully about her at
the vivid turf, the delicate shimmer of blowing
leaves, and the tossing ocean, as if trying
to photograph each detail in her memory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>"I shall see nothing so beautiful over
there," she said. "Dear old Devonshire,
there's nothing like it."</p>

<p>"Colorado is even better than 'dear old
Devonshire,'" declared her brother; "wait
till you see Pike's Peak. Wait till I drive
you through the North Cheyenne Canyon."</p>

<p>But Imogen shook her head incredulously.</p>

<p>"Pike's Peak!" she answered, with an air of
scorn. "The name is enough; I never want
to see it."</p>

<p>"Well, you girls are good walkers, it must
be confessed;" said Lionel, as they emerged
on the crossing of the Bideford road where they
must separate. "Isabel looks as fresh as paint,
and Moggy hasn't turned a hair. I don't
think Mrs. Geoff could stand such a walk, or
any of her family."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, indeed; Clover would feel half-killed
if she were asked to undertake a sixteen-mile
walk. I remember, when she was
here, we just went down to the pier at Clovelly
for a row on the Bay and back through
the Hobby, six miles in all, perhaps, and she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
was quite done up, poor dear, and had to go
on to the sofa. I can't think why American
girls are not better walkers,&mdash;though there
<i>was</i> that Miss Appleton we met at Zermatt,
who went up the Matterhorn and didn't
make much of it. Good-by, Imogen; I shall
come over before you start and fetch mamma's
parcels."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>MISS OPDYKE FROM NEW YORK.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE next week was a busy one. Packing
had begun; and what with Mrs.
Young's motherly desire to provide
her children with every possible convenience
for their new home, and Imogen's rooted conviction
that nothing could be found in Colorado
worth buying, and that it was essential
to carry out all the tapes and sewing-silk
and buttons and shoe-thread and shoes and
stationery and court-plaster and cotton cloth
and medicines that she and Lionel could possibly
require during the next five years,&mdash;it
promised to be a long job.</div>

<p>In vain did Lionel remonstrate, and assure
his sister that every one of these things could
be had equally well at St. Helen's, where some
of them went almost every day, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
extra baggage cost so much on the Pacific
railways that the price of such commodities
would be nearly doubled before she got them
safely to the High Valley.</p>

<p>"Now what can be the use of taking two
pounds of pins, for example?" he protested.
"Pins are as plenty as blackberries in America.
And all those spools of thread too!"</p>

<p>"Reels of cotton, do you mean? I wish
you would speak English, at least while we
are in England. I shouldn't dare go without
plenty of such things. American cotton isn't
as good as ours; I've always been told that."</p>

<p>"Well, it's good enough, as you'll find.
And do make a place for something pretty;
a few nice tea-cups for instance, and some
things to hold flowers, and some curtain
stuffs for the windows, and photographs.
Geoff and Mrs. Geoff have made their house
awfully nice, I can tell you. Americans think
a deal of that sort of thing. All this haberdashery
and hardware is ridiculous, and you'll
be sorry enough that you didn't listen to me
before you are through with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mother has packed some cups already, I
believe, and I'll take that white Minton jar
if you like, but really I shouldn't think delicate
things like that would be at all suitable
in a new place like Colorado, where people
must rough it as we are going to do. You
are so infatuated about America, Lion, that I
can't trust your opinion at all."</p>

<p>"I've been there, and you haven't," was
all that Lionel urged in answer. It seemed
an incontrovertible argument, but Imogen
made no attempt to overthrow it. She only
packed on according to her own ideas, quite
unconvinced.</p>

<p>It lacked only five days of their setting out
when she and her brother walked into Bideford
one afternoon for some last errands. It
was June now, and the south of England was
at its freshest and fairest. The meadows
along the margin of the Torridge wore their
richest green, the hill slopes above them
were a bloom of soft color. Each court yard
and garden shimmered with the gold of laburnums
or the purple and white of clustering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
clematis; and the scent of flowers came with
every puff of air.</p>

<p>As they passed up the side street, a carriage
with three strange ladies in it drove
by them. It stopped at the door of the New
Inn,&mdash;as quaint in build and even older
than the New Inn of Clovelly. The ladies
got out, and one of them, to Imogen's great
surprise, came forward and extended her
hand to Lionel.</p>

<p>"Mr. Young,&mdash;it is Mr. Young, isn't it?
You've quite forgotten me, I fear,&mdash;Mrs.
Page. We met at St. Helen's two years ago
when I stopped to see my son. Let me introduce
you to my daughter, the Comtesse de
Conflans, and Miss Opdyke, of New York."</p>

<p>Lionel could do no less than stop, shake
hands, and present his sister, whereupon Mrs.
Page urged them both to come in for a few
minutes and have a cup of tea.</p>

<p>"We are here only till the evening-train,"
she explained,&mdash;"just to see Westward Ho
and get a glimpse of the Amyas Leigh country.
And I want to ask any quantity of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
questions about Clarence and his wife. What!
you are going out to the High Valley next
week, and your sister too? Oh, that makes
it absolutely impossible for me to let you
off. You really must come in. There are
so many messages I should like to send, and
a cup of tea will be a nice rest for Miss
Young after her long walk."</p>

<p>"It isn't long at all," protested Imogen;
but Mrs. Page could not be gainsaid, and
led the way upstairs to a sitting-room with
a bay window overlooking the windings of
the Torridge, which was crammed with quaint
carved furniture of all sorts. There were
buffets, cabinets, secretaries, delightful old
claw-footed tables and sofas, and chairs whose
backs and arms were a mass of griffins and
heraldic emblems. Old oak was the specialty
of the landlady of this New Inn, it seemed,
as blue china was of the other. For years
she had attended sales and poked about in
farmhouses and attics, till little by little she
had accumulated an astonishing collection.
Many of the pieces were genuine antiques,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
but some had been constructed under her own
eye from wood equally venerable,&mdash;pew-ends
and fragments of rood-screens purchased
from a dismantled and ruined church. The
effect was both picturesque and unusual.</p>

<p>Mrs. Page seated her guests in two wide,
high-backed chairs, rang for tea, and began
to question Lionel about affairs in the High
Valley, while Imogen, still under the influence
of surprise at finding herself calling on
these strangers, glanced curiously at the
younger ladies of the party. The Comtesse
de Conflans was still young, and evidently had
been very pretty, but she had a worn, dissatisfied
air, and did not look happy. Imogen
learned afterward that her marriage, which
was considered a triumph and a grand affair
when it took place, had not turned out very
well. Count Ernest de Conflans was rather
a black sheep in some respects, had a strong
taste for baccarat and <i>rouge et noir</i>, and spent
so much of his bride's money at these amusements
during the first year of their life together,
that her friends became alarmed, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
their interference had brought about a sort
of amicable separation. Count Ernest lived
in Washington, receiving a specified sum out
of his wife's income, and she was travelling
indefinitely in Europe with her mother. It
was no wonder that she did not look satisfied
and content.</p>

<p>"Miss Opdyke, of New York" was quite different
and more attractive, Imogen thought.
She had never seen any one in the least like
her. Rather tall, with a long slender throat,
a waist of fabulous smallness, and hands
which, in their <i>gants de Su&egrave;de</i>, did not seem
more than two inches wide, she gave the impression
of being as fragile in make and as
delicately fibred as an exotic flower. She
had pretty, arch, gray eyes, a skin as white
as a magnolia blossom, and a fluff of wonderful
pale hair&mdash;artlessly looped and pinned
to look as if it had blown by accident into
its place&mdash;which yet exactly suited the face
it framed. She was restlessly vivacious,
her mobile mouth twitched with a hidden
amusement every other moment; when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
smiled she revealed pearly teeth and a dimple;
and she smiled often. Her dress, apparently
simple, was a wonder of fit and cut,&mdash;a skirt
of dark fawn-brown, a blouse of ivory-white
silk, elaborately tucked and shirred, a cape
of glossy brown fur whose high collar set off
her pale vivid face, and a "picture hat" with
a wreath of plumes. Imogen, whose preconceived
notion of an American girl included
diamond ear-rings sported morning, noon, and
night, observed with surprise that she wore
no ornaments except one slender bangle.
She had in her hand a great bunch of yellow
roses, which exactly toned in with the ivory
and brown of her dress, and she played with
these and smelled them, as she sat on a high
black-oak settle, and, consciously or unconsciously,
made a picture of herself.</p>

<p>She seemed as much surprised and entertained
at Imogen as Imogen could possibly
be at her.</p>

<p>"I suppose you run up to London often,"
was her first remark.</p>

<p>"N-o, not often." In fact, Imogen had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
been in London only once in the whole course
of her life.</p>

<p>"Dear me!&mdash;don't you? Why, how can
you exist without it? I shouldn't think
there would be anything to do here that was
in the least amusing,&mdash;not a thing. How do
you spend your time?"</p>

<p>"I?&mdash;I don't know, I'm sure. There's
always plenty to do."</p>

<p>"To do, yes; but in the way of amusement,
I mean. Do you have many balls?
Is there any gayety going on? Where do
you find your men?"</p>

<p>"No, we don't have balls often, but we
have lawn parties, and tennis, and once a
year there's a school feast."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know,&mdash;children in gingham
frocks and pinafores, eating buns and drinking
milk-and-hot-water out of mugs. Rapturous
fun it must be,&mdash;but I think one might
get tired of it in time. As for lawn parties,
I tried one in Fulham the other day, and I
don't want to go to any more in England,
thank you. They never introduced a soul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to us, the band played out of tune, it was as
dull as ditch-water,&mdash;just dreary, ill-dressed
people wandering in and out, and trying to
look as if five sour strawberries on a plate,
and a thimbleful of ice cream were bliss and
high life and all the rest of it. The only
thing really nice was the roses; those <i>were</i>
delicious. Lady Mary Ponsonby gave me
three,&mdash;to make up for not presenting any
one to me, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Do you still keep up the old fashion of
introductions in America?" said Imogen with
calm superiority. "It's quite gone out with
us. We take it for granted that well-bred
people will talk to their neighbors at parties,
and enjoy themselves well enough for the
moment, and then they needn't be hampered
with knowing them afterward. It saves a
lot of complications not having to remember
names, or bow to people."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that's the theory, but I call
it a custom introduced for the suppression
of strangers. Of course, if you know all the
people present, or who they are, it doesn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
matter in the least; but if you don't, it
makes it a ghastly mockery to try to enjoy
yourself at a party. But do tell me some
more about Bideford. I'm so curious about
English country life. I've seen only London
so far. Is it ever warm over here?"</p>

<p>"Warm?" vaguely, "what do you mean?"</p>

<p>"I mean <i>warm</i>. Perhaps the word is not
known over here, or doesn't mean the same
thing. England seems to me just one degree
better than Nova Zembla. The sun is
a mere imitation sun. He looks yellow, like
a real one, when you see him,&mdash;which isn't
often,&mdash;but he doesn't burn a bit. I've had
the shivers steadily ever since we landed."
She pulled her fur cape closer about her ears
as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Why, what can you want different from
this?" asked Imogen, surprised. "It's a
lovely day. We haven't had a drop of rain
since last night."</p>

<p>"That is quite true, and remarkable as
true; but somehow I don't feel any warmer
than I did when it rained. Ah, here comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
the tea. Let me pour it, Mrs. Page. I make
awfully good tea. Such nice, thick cream!
but, oh, dear!&mdash;here is more of that awful
bread."</p>

<p>It was a stout household loaf, of the sort
invariable in south-county England, substantial,
crusty, and tough, with a "nubbin" on
top, and in consistency something between
pine wood and sole leather. Miss Opdyke,
after filling her cups, proceeded to cut the
loaf in slices, protesting as she did so that it
"creaked in the chewing," and that</p>

<div class='poem'>"The muscular strength that it gave to her jaw<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Would last her the rest of her life."</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Why, what sort of bread do you have
in America?" demanded Imogen, astonished
and offended by the frankness of these strictures.
"This is the sort every one eats here.
I'm sure it's excellent. What is there about
it that you don't like?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everything. Wait till you taste our
American bread, and you'll understand,&mdash;or
rather, our breads, for we have dozens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
of kinds, each more delicious than the last.
Wait till you eat corn-bread and waffles."</p>

<p>"I've always been told that the American
food was dreadfully messy," observed Imogen,
nettled into reprisals; "pepper on eggs,
and all that sort of thing,&mdash;very messy and
nasty, indeed."</p>

<p>"Well, we <i>have</i> deviated from the English
method as to the eating of eggs, I admit. I
know it's correct to chip the shell, and eat
all the white at one end by itself, with a
little salt, and then all the yellow in the
middle, and last of all the white at the other
end by itself; but there are bold spirits
among us who venture to stir and mix. Fools
rush in, you know; they <i>will</i> do it, even
where Britons fear to tread."</p>

<p>"We stopped at Northam to see Sir
Amyas Leigh's house," Mrs. Page was saying
to Lionel. "It's really very interesting
to visit the spots where celebrated people
have lived. There is a sad lack of such
places in America. We are such a new country.
Lilly and Miss Opdyke walked up to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the hill where Mrs. Leigh stood to see the
Spanish ship come in,&mdash;quite fascinating,
they said it was."</p>

<p>"You must be sure to stay long enough
in Boston to see the house where Silas
Lapham lived," put in the wicked Miss Opdyke.
"One cannot see too much of places
associated with famous people."</p>

<p>"I don't remember any such name in
American history," said honest Imogen,&mdash;"'Silas
Lapham,' who was he?"</p>

<p>"A man in a novel, and Amyas Leigh is
a man in another novel," whispered Miss
Opdyke. "Mrs. Page isn't quite sure about
him, but she doesn't like to confess as frankly
as you do. She has forgotten, and fancies
that he really lived in Queen Elizabeth's time;
and the coachman was so solemnly sure that
he did that it's not much wonder. I bought
an old silver patch-box in a jeweller's shop on
the High Street, and I'm going to tell my
sister that it belonged to Ayacanora."</p>

<p>"What an odd idea."</p>

<p>"We are full of odd ideas over in America,
you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Tell me something about the States," said
Imogen. "My brother is quite mad over
Colorado, but he doesn't know much about
the rest of it. I suppose the country about
New York isn't very wild, is it?"</p>

<p>"Not very," returned Miss Opdyke, with
a twinkle. "The buffalo are rarely seen now,
and only two men were scalped by the Indians
outside the walls of the city last year."</p>

<p>"Fancy! And how do you pass your time?
Is it a gay place?"</p>

<p>"Very. We pass our time doing all sorts
of things. There's the Corn Dance and the
Green Currant Dance and the Water Melon
pow wow, of course, and beside these,
which date back to the early days of the
colony, we have the more modern amusements,
German opera and Italian opera and
the theatre and subscription concerts. Then
we have balls nearly every night in the season
and dinner-parties and luncheons and
lectures and musical parties, and we study
a good deal and 'slum' a little. Last winter
I belonged to a Greek class and a fencing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
class, and a quartette club, and two private
dancing classes, and a girls' working club,
and an amateur theatrical society. We gave
two private concerts for charities, you know,
and acted the Antigone for the benefit of the
Influenza Hospital. Oh, there is a plenty to
pass one's time in New York, I can assure you.
And when other amusements fail, we can go
outside the walls, with a guard of trappers,
of course, and try our hand at converting the
natives."</p>

<p>"What tribe of Indians is it that you have
near you?"</p>

<p>"The Tammanies,&mdash;a very trying tribe, I
assure you. It seems impossible to make
any impression on them or teach them
anything."</p>

<p>"Fancy! Did you ever have any adventures
yourself with these Indians?" asked
Imogen, deeply excited over this veracious
resum&eacute; of life in modern New York.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, yes&mdash;frequently."</p>

<p>"Do tell me some of yours. This is so
very interesting. Lionel never has said a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
word about the&mdash;Tallamies, did you call
them?"</p>

<p>"Tammanies. Perhaps not; Colorado is so
far off, you know. They have Piutes there,&mdash;a
different tribe entirely, and much less
deleterious to civilization."</p>

<p>"How sad. But about the adventures?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes&mdash;well, I'll tell you of one; in
fact it is the only really exciting experience I
ever had with the New York Indians. It was
two years ago; I had just come out, and it was
my birthday, and papa said I might ride his
new mustang, by way of a celebration. So we
started, my brother and I, for a long country
gallop.</p>

<p>"We were just on the other side of Central
Park, barely out of the city, you see, when a
sudden blood-curdling yell filled the air. We
were horror-struck, for we knew at once what
it must be,&mdash;the war-cry of the savages. We
turned of course and galloped for our lives,
but the Indians were between us and the
gates. We could see their terrible faces
streaked with war-paint, and the tomahawks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
at their girdles, and we felt that all hope was
over. I caught hold of papa's lasso, which
was looped round the saddle, and cocked my
revolving rifle&mdash;all the New York girls wear
revolving rifles strapped round their waists,"
continued Miss Opdyke, coolly, interrogating
Imogen with her eyes as she spoke for signs
of disbelief, but finding none&mdash;"and I resolved
to sell my life and scalp as dearly as
possible. Just then, when all seemed lost,
we heard a shout which sounded like music to
our ears. A company of mounted Rangers
were galloping out from the city. They
had seen our peril from one of the watch-towers,
and had hurried to our rescue."</p>

<p>"How fortunate!" said Imogen, drawing a
long breath. "Well, go on&mdash;do go on."</p>

<p>"There is little more to tell," said Miss
Opdyke, controlling with difficulty her inclination
to laugh. "The Head Ranger attacked
the Tammany chief, whose name was
Day Vidbehill,&mdash;a queer name, isn't it?&mdash;and
slew him after a bloody conflict. He gave
me his brush, I mean his scalp-lock, afterward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and it now adorns&mdash;" Here her
amusement became ungovernable, and she
went into fits of laughter, which Imogen's
astonished look only served to increase.</p>

<p>"Oh!" she cried, between her paroxysms,
"you believed it all! it is too absurd,
but you really believed it! I thought till
just now that you were only pretending, to
amuse me."</p>

<p>"Wasn't it true, then?" said Imogen, her
tardy wits waking slowly up to the conclusion.</p>

<p>"True! why, my dear child, New York
is the third city of the world in size,&mdash;not
quite so large as London, but approaching it.
It is a great, brilliant, gay place, where everything
under the sun can be bought and seen
and done. Did you really think we had Indians
and buffaloes close by us?"</p>

<p>"And haven't you?"</p>

<p>"Dear me, no. There never was a buffalo
within a thousand miles of us, and not an
Indian has come within shooting distance for
half a century, unless he came by train to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
take part in a show. You mustn't be so
easily taken in. People will impose upon
you no end over in America, unless you are
on your guard. What has your brother been
about, not to explain things better?"</p>

<p>"Well, he <i>has</i> tried," said Imogen, candidly,
"but I didn't half believe what he said, because
it was so different from the things in
the books. And then he is so in love with
America that it seemed as if he must be exaggerating.
He did say that the cities were
just like our cities, only more so, and that
though the West wasn't like England at all,
it was very interesting to live in; but I didn't
half listen to him, it sounded so impossible."</p>

<p>"Live and learn. You'll have a great
many surprises when you get across, but
some of them will be pleasant ones, and I
think you'll like it. Good-by," as Imogen
rose to go; "I hope we shall meet again some
time, and then you will tell me how you
like Colorado, and the Piutes, and&mdash;waffles.
I hope to live yet to see you stirring an egg
in a glass with pepper and a 'messy' lump of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
butter in true Western fashion. It's awfully
good, I've always been told. Do forgive me
for hoaxing you. I never thought you <i>could</i>
believe me, and when I found that you did, it
was irresistible to go on."</p>

<p>"I can't make out at all about Americans,"
said Imogen, plaintively, as after an effusive
farewell from Mrs. Page and a languid bow
from Madame de Conflans they were at last
suffered to escape into the street. "There
seem to be so many different kinds. Mrs.
Page and her daughter are not a bit like
each other, and Miss Opdyke is quite different
from either of them, and none of the
three resembles Mrs. Geoffrey Templestowe
in the least."</p>

<p>"And neither does Buffalo Bill and your
phrenological lecturer. Courage, Moggy. I
told you America was a sizable place. You'll
begin to take in and understand the meaning
of the variety show after you once get over
there."</p>

<p>"It was queer, but do you know I couldn't
help rather liking that girl;" confessed Imogen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
later to Isabel Templestowe. "She was
odd, of course, and not a bit English, but you
couldn't say she was bad form, and she was
so remarkably quick and bright. It seemed
as if she had seen all sorts of things and tried
her hand on almost everything, and wasn't a
bit afraid to say what she thought, or to praise
and find fault. I told you what she said about
English bread, and she was just as rude about
our vegetables; she said they were only flavored
with hot water. What do you suppose
she meant?"</p>

<p>"I believe they cook them quite differently
in America. Geoff likes their way, and found
a great deal of fault when he was at home
with the cauliflower and the Brussels sprouts.
He declared that they had no taste, and that
mint in green-peas killed the flavor. Clover
was too polite to say anything, but I could
see that she thought the same. Mamma was
quite put about with Geoff's new notions."</p>

<p>"I must say that it seems rather impertinent
and forth-putting for a new nation like
that to be setting up opinions of its own,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and finding fault with the good old English
customs," said Imogen, petulantly.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't know," replied Isabel; "we
have made some changes ourselves. John
of Gaunt or Harry Hotspur might find fault
with us for the same reason, giving up the
'good old customs' of rushes on the floor,
for instance, and flagons of ale for breakfast.
There were the stocks and the pillory
too, and hanging for theft, and the torture of
prisoners. Those were all in use more or
less when the Pilgrims went to America,
and I'm sure we're all glad that they were
given up. The world must move, and I suppose
it's but natural that the new nations
should give it its impulse."</p>

<p>"England is good enough for me," replied
the practical Imogen. "I don't want to be instructed
by new countries. It's like a child
in a pinafore trying to teach its grandmother
how to do things. Now, dear Isabel, let me
hear about your mother's parcels."</p>

<p>Mrs. Templestowe had wisely put her gifts
into small compass. There were two dainty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
little frocks for her grandson, and a jacket
of her own knitting, two pairs of knickerbocker
stockings for Geoff, and for Clover a
bit of old silver which had belonged to a Templestowe
in the time of the Tudors,&mdash;a double-handled
porringer with a coat of arms engraved
on its somewhat dented sides. Clover,
like most Americans, had a passion for the
antique; so this present was sure to please.</p>

<p>"And you are really off to-morrow," said
Isabel at the gate. "How I wish I were going
too."</p>

<p>"And how I wish I were not going at all,
but staying on with you," responded Imogen.
"Mother says if Lionel isn't married by the
end of three years she'll send Beatrice out
to take my place. She'll be turned twenty
then, and would like to come. Isabel, you'll
be married before I get back, I know you
will."</p>

<p>"It's most improbable. Girls don't marry
in England half so easily as in America. It
will be you who will marry, and settle over
there permanently."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never!" cried Imogen.</p>

<p>Then the two friends exchanged a last kiss
and parted.</p>

<p>"My love to Clover," Isabel called back.</p>

<p>"Always Clover," thought Imogen; but she
smiled, and answered, "Yes."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>THE LAST OF DEVON AND THE FIRST OF AMERICA.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 102px;">
<img src="images/drop_w.png" width="102" height="100" alt="W" title="W" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ITH the morrow came the parting
from home. "Farewell" is never an
easy word to say when seas are to
separate those who love each other, but the
Young family uttered it bravely and resolutely.
Lionel, who was impatient to get
to work and to his beloved High Valley, was
more than ready to go. His face, among the
sober ones, looked aggressively cheerful.</div>

<p>"Cheer up, mother," he said, consolingly.
"You'll be coming over in a year or two with
the Pater, and Moggy and I will give you such
a good time as you never had in your lives.
We'll all go up to Estes Park and camp out
for a month. I can see you now coming down
the trail on a burro,&mdash;what fun it will be."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>"Who knows?" said Mrs. Young, with a
smile that was half a sigh. She and her husband
had sent a good many sons and daughters
out into the world to seek their fortunes,
and so far not one of them had come back.
To be sure, all were doing well in their several
ways,&mdash;Cyril in India, where he had an excellent
appointment, and the second boy in the
army; two were in the navy, and Tom and
Giles in Van Diemen's Land, where they were
making a very good thing out of a sheep ranch.
There was no reason why Lionel should not
be equally lucky with his cattle in Colorado;
there were younger children to be considered;
it was "all in the day's work," the natural
thing. Large families must separate, parents
could not expect to keep their grown boys
and girls with them always. So they dismissed
the two who were now going forth
cheerfully, uncomplainingly, and with their
blessing, but all the same it was not pleasant;
and Mrs. Young shed some quiet tears in the
privacy of her own room, and her husband
looked very serious as he strode down the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Southampton docks after saying good-by to
his children on board the steamer.</p>

<p>Imogen had never been on a great sea-going
vessel before, and it struck her as being
very crowded and confused as well as bewilderingly
big. She stood clutching her bags and
bundles nervously and feeling homesick and
astray while farewells and greetings went on
about her, and the people who were going and
those who were to stay behind seemed mixed
in an inextricable tangle on the decks. Then
a bell rang, and gradually the groups separated;
those who were not going formed themselves
into a black mass on the pier; there was
a great fluttering of handkerchiefs, a plunge
of the screw, and the steamer was off.</p>

<p>Lionel, who had been seeing to the baggage,
now appeared, and took Imogen down to her
stateroom, advising her to get out all her warm
things and make ready for a rough night.</p>

<p>"There's quite a sea on outside," he remarked.
"We're in for a rolling if not for
a pitching."</p>

<p>"Lion!" cried Imogen, indignantly. "Do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
you mean to say that you suppose I'm going
to be sick,&mdash;I, a Devonshire girl born and
bred, who have lived by the sea all my life?
Never!"</p>

<p>"Time will show," was the oracular response.
"Get the rugs out, any way, and
your brushes and combs and things, and advise
Miss What-d'-you-call-her to do the same."</p>

<p>"Miss What-d'-you-call-her" was Imogen's
room-mate, a perfectly unknown girl, who had
been to her imagination one of the chief bug-bears
of the voyage. She was curled up on the
sofa in a tumbled little heap when they entered
the stateroom, had evidently been crying,
and did not look at all formidable, being
no older than Imogen, very small and shy, a
soft, dark-eyed appealing creature, half English,
half Belgic by extraction, and going out,
it appeared, to join a lover who for three
years had been in California making ready
for her. He was to meet her in New York,
with a clergyman in his pocket, so to speak,
and as soon as the marriage ceremony was
performed, they were to set out for their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
ranch in the San Gabriel Valley, to raise
grapes, dry raisins, and "live happily all the
days of their lives afterward," like the prince
and princess of a fairy tale.</p>

<p>These confidences were not made immediately
or all at once, but gradually, as the two
girls became acquainted, and mutual suffering
endeared them to each other. For, <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original">in</ins> spite
of Imogen's Devonshire bringing up, the English
Channel proved too much for her, and she
had to endure two pretty bad days before,
promoted from gruel to dry toast, and from
dry toast to beef-tea, she was able to be
helped on deck, and seated, well wrapped up,
in a reclining chair to inhale the cold, salty
wind which was the best and only medicine
for her particular kind of ailment.</p>

<p>The chair next hers was occupied by a
pretty, dark-eyed, and very lady-like woman,
with whom Lionel had apparently made an
acquaintance; for he said, as he tucked Imogen's
rugs about her, "Here's my sister at
last, you see;" which off-hand introduction
the lady acknowledged with a pleasant smile,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
saying she was glad to see Miss Young able
to be up. Her manner was so unaffected
and cordial that Imogen's stiffness melted under
its influence, and before she knew it they
were talking quite like old acquaintances.</p>

<p>Imogen was struck by the sweet voice of
the stranger, with its well-bred modulations,
and also by the good taste and perfection of
all her little appointments, from the down
pillow at top of her chair to the fur-trimmed
shoes on a pair of particularly pretty feet at
the other end. She set her down in her own
mind as a London dame of fashion,&mdash;perhaps
a countess, or a Lady Something-or-other,
who was going out to see America.</p>

<p>"Your brother tells me this is your first
voyage," said the lady.</p>

<p>"Yes. He has been out before, but none
of us were with him. It's all perfectly
strange to me"&mdash;with a sigh.</p>

<p>"Why do you sigh? Don't you expect to
like it?"</p>

<p>"Why no, not <i>like it</i> exactly. Of course
I'm glad to be with Lionel and of use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to him, but I didn't come away from home
for pleasure."</p>

<p>"Pleasure must come to you, then," said
the lady, with a smile. "And really I don't
see why it shouldn't. In the first place you
are acting the part of a good sister; and
you know the adage about duty performed
making rainbows in the soul. And then Colorado
is a beautiful State, with the finest of
mountain views, a wonderful climate, and
such wild flowers as grow nowhere else. I
have some friends living there who are quite
infatuated about it. They say there is no
place so delightful in the world."</p>

<p>"That is just the way with my brother.
It's really absurd the way he talks about it.
You would think it was better than England!"</p>

<p>"It is sure to be very different; but all
the same, you will like it, I think."</p>

<p>"I hope so"&mdash;doubtfully.</p>

<p>Just then came an interruption in the shape
of a tall girl of fifteen or sixteen, with a sweet,
childish face who came running down the
deck accompanied by a maid, and seized the
strange lady's hand.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma," she began, "the first officer
says that if you are willing he will take me
across to the bows to see the rainbows on the
foam. May I go? He says Anne can go
too."</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly, if Mr. Graves will take
charge of you. But first speak to this young
lady, who is the sister of Mr. Young, who
was so kind about playing ship-coil with you
yesterday, and tell her you are glad she is
able to be on deck. Then you can go,
Amy."</p>

<p>Amy turned a pair of beautiful, long-lashed,
gray eyes on Imogen.</p>

<p>"I'm glad you're better, Miss Young.
Mamma and I were sorry you were so sick,"
she said, with a frank politeness that was
charming. "It must be very disagreeable."</p>

<p>"Haven't you been sick, then?" said
Imogen, holding fast the little hand that was
put in hers.</p>

<p>"No, I'm never sick <i>now</i>. I was, though,
the first time we came over, and I behaved
<i>awfully</i>. Do you recollect, mamma?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Only too well," said her mother, laughing.
"You were like a caged bird, beating yourself
against the bars in desperation."</p>

<p>Amy lingered a moment, while a dimple
played in her pink cheek as if she were
moved by some amusing remembrance.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's Mr. Graves," she said. "I
must go. I'll come back presently and tell
you about the rainbows, mamma."</p>

<p>"I suppose most of these people on board
are Americans," said Imogen after a little
pause. "It's always easy to tell them, don't
you think?"</p>

<p>"Not always. Yes, I suppose a good many
of them are&mdash;or call themselves so."</p>

<p>"What do you mean by 'call themselves
so'? That girl is one, I am sure," indicating
a pretty, stylish young person, who was talking
rather too loudly for good taste with the
ship's doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes, I imagine she is."</p>

<p>"And those people over there," pointing
to a large, red-bearded man who lay back in
a sea-chair reading a novel, by the side of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fat wife who read another, while their little
boy raced up and down the deck quite unheeded,
and amused himself by pulling the
rugs off the knees of the sicker passengers.
"They are Americans, I know! Did you ever
see such creatures? The idea of letting that
child make a nuisance of himself like that!
No one but an American would allow it. I've
always heard that children in the States do
exactly as they please, and the grown people
never interfere with them in the least."</p>

<p>"General rules are dangerous things," said
her neighbor, with an odd little smile. "Now,
as it happens, I know all about those people.
They call themselves Americans because they
have lived in Buffalo for ten years and are
naturalized; but he was born in Scotland and
she in Wales, and the child doesn't belong
exactly to any country, for he happened to
be born at sea. You see you can't always
tell."</p>

<p>"Do you mean, then, that they are English,
after all?" cried Imogen, disconcerted and
surprised.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no. Every body is an American who
has taken the oath of allegiance. Those
Polish Jews over there are Americans, and
that Italian couple also, and the big party of
Germans who are sitting between the boats.
The Germans have a large shop in New York,
and go out every year to buy goods and tell
their relations how superior the United States
are to Breslau. They are all Americans,
though you would scarcely suppose it to look
at them. America is like a pudding,&mdash;plums
from one part of the world, and spice from
another, and flour and sugar and flavoring
from somewhere else, but all known by the
name of pudding."</p>

<p>"How very, very odd. Somehow I never
thought of it before in that light. Are there
no real Americans, then? Are they all foreigners
who have been naturalized?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no. It is not so bad as that. There
are a great many 'real Americans.' I am
one, for example."</p>

<p>"You!" There was such a world of unfeigned
surprise in Imogen's tone that it was
impossible for her new friend not to laugh.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I. Did you not know it? What did you
take me for?"</p>

<p>"Why, English of course, like myself. You
are exactly like an English person."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean it for a compliment;
thank you, therefore. I like England very
much, so I don't mind being taken for an
English woman."</p>

<p>"Of course you don't," said Imogen, staring.
"It's the height of an American's ambition,
I've always heard, to be thought English."</p>

<p>"There you are mistaken. There are a
few foolish people who feel so no doubt, and
all of us would be glad to copy what is best
and nicest in English ways and manners,
but a really good American likes his own
country best of all, and would rather seem to
belong to it than any other."</p>

<p>"And I was thinking how different your
daughter is from the American girls!" said
Imogen, continuing her own train of thought;
"and how her manners were so pretty,
and did such credit to <i>us</i>, and would surprise
people over there! How very odd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
I shall never get to understand the Americans.
They're so different from each other
as well as from us. There were some ladies
from New York at Bideford the other day,&mdash;a
Mrs. Page and a Comtesse de Something-or-other,
her daughter, and a Miss Opdyke from
New York. <i>She</i> was very pretty and really
quite nice, though rather queer, but all three
were as unlike each other as they could be.
Do you know them in America?"</p>

<p>"Not Miss Opdyke; but I have met Mrs.
Page once in Europe a good while since.
It was before her daughter was married.
She is a relative of my sister-in-law, Mrs.
Worthington."</p>

<p>"Do you mean the Mrs. Worthington
whose husband is in the navy? Why, that's
Mrs. Geoffrey Templestowe's sister!"</p>

<p>"Do you know Clover Templestowe, then?"
said the lady, surprised in her turn. "That is
really curious. Was it in England that you
met?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and we are on our way to her neighborhood
now. My brother has bought a share<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
in Geoff's business, and we are going to live
near them at High Valley."</p>

<p>"I do call this an extraordinary coincidence.
Amy, come here and listen. This young lady
is on her way to Colorado, to live close to Aunt
Clover; what do you think of that for a surprise?
I don't wonder that you open your
eyes so wide. Isn't it just like a story-book
that she should have come and sat down in the
next chair to ours?"</p>

<p>"It's so funny that I can't believe it, till I
take time to think," said Amy, perching herself
on the arm of her mother's seat. "Just
think, you'll see Elsie and her baby, and
Aunt Clover's baby, and Uncle Geoff and
Phil, and all of them. It's the beautifulest
place out there that you ever saw. There
are whole droves of horses, and you ride all
the while, and when you're not riding you
can pick flowers and play with the babies.
Oh, I wish I were going with you; it would
be such fun!"</p>

<p>"But aren't you coming?" said Imogen,
much taken by the frankness of the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
American maid. "Coax mamma to fetch
you out this summer, and come and make me
a visit. We're going to have a little cabin
of our own, and I'd be delighted to have
you. Is it far from where you live?"</p>

<p>"Well, it's what you would call 'a goodish
bit' in England," replied Mrs. Ashe,&mdash;"two
thousand miles or so, nearly three days' journey.
Amy would be charmed to come, I am
sure, but I am afraid the distance will stand
in her way. One doesn't 'step out' to Colorado
every summer, but perhaps we may
be there some day, and then we shall certainly
hope to see you."</p>

<p>This encounter with Mrs. Ashe, who was, in
a way, part of the family with whom Imogen
expected to be most intimately associated
in America, made the remainder of the voyage
very pleasant. They sat together for
hours every day, talking, and reading, and
gradually Imogen waked up to the fact that
American life and society was a much more
complex and less easily understood affair than
she had imagined.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>The weather was favorable when the first
rough days were past, and after they rounded
the curve of the wide sea hemisphere and began
to near the American coast it became
beautiful, with high-arching skies and very
bright sunsets. Accustomed to the low-hung
grays and struggling sunbeams of southern
England, Imogen could not get used to these
novelties. Her surprise over the dazzle of
the day and the clear, vivid blue of the heavens
was a continual amusement and joy to
Mrs. Ashe, who took a patriotic pride in her
own climate, and, as it were, made herself responsible
for it.</p>

<p>Then came the eventful morning, when,
rousing to the first glow of dawn, they found
the screw motionless, and the steamer lying
off a green island, with a big barrack-building
on it, over which waved the American
flag. The health officer made his visit, and before
long they were steaming up the wide bay
of New York, between green, flowery shores,
under the colossal Liberty, whose outstretched
arm seemed to point to the dim rich mass of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
roofs and towers and spires of the city which
lay beyond. Then they neared the landing-stage,
where a black mass of people stood
waiting them, and Amy gave a cry of delight
as she saw a gold-banded cap among them,
and recognized her Uncle Ned.</p>

<p>The little Anglo-Belgian had been more
or less ill all the way over, and looked pale
and wan, though still very pretty, as she
stood with the rest, gazing at the crowd of
faces, all of whose eyes were turned toward
the steamer. Imogen, who had helped her to
dress, remained protectingly by her side.</p>

<p>"What shall you do if he doesn't happen
to be there?" she asked, smitten with a sudden
fear. "Something might detain him, you
know."</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;am not sure," turning pale. "Oh,
yes, I am," rallying. "He have aunt in Howbokken.
I go there and wait. But he not fail;
he will be here." Then her eyes suddenly lit up,
and she exclaimed with a little shriek of joy,
"He <i>are</i> here! That is he standing by the big
timber. My Karl! my Karl! He are here!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>There indeed he was, foremost in the
throng, a tall, brown, handsome fellow, with
a nice, strong face, and such a look of love
and expectation in his eyes that prosaic Imogen
suddenly felt that it might be worth
while, after all, to cross half the world to
meet a look and a husband like that,&mdash;a fact
which she had disbelieved till now, demurring
also in her private mind as to the propriety of
such a thing. It was pretty to see the tender
happiness in the girl's face, and the answering
expression of her lover's. It seemed to put
poetry and pathos into an otherwise commonplace
scene. The gang-plank was lowered, a
crowd of people surged ashore, to be met by
a corresponding surge from the on-lookers,
and in the midst of it Lieutenant Worthington
leaped aboard and hastened to where his
sister stood waiting him.</p>

<p>"You're coming up to Newport with me at
five-thirty," were his first words. "Katy's
all ready, and means to sit up till the boat
gets in at two-thirty, keeping a little supper
hot and hot for you. The Torpedo Station is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in its glory just now, and there's going to be
a great explosion on Thursday, which Amy
will enjoy."</p>

<p>"How lovely!" cried Amy, clinging to her
uncle's arm. "I love explosions. Why didn't
Tanta come too?&mdash;I'm in such a hurry to
see her."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Worthington asked to be introduced
to Imogen and Lionel, and explained
that acting on a request from Geoffrey Templestowe,
he had taken rooms for them at a hotel,
and secured their tickets and sleeping sections
in the "limited" train for the next day.</p>

<p>"And I told them to save two seats for
Rip Van Winkle to-night till you got there,"
he added. "If you're not too tired I advise
you to go. Jefferson is an experience which
you ought not to miss, and you may never
have another chance."</p>

<p>"How awfully kind your brother is," said
the surprised Imogen to Mrs. Ashe; "all this
trouble, and he never saw either of us before!
It's very good of him."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's nothing. That's the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
American men do. They <i>are</i> perfect dears,
there's no doubt as to that, and they don't
consider anything a trouble which helps along
a friend or a friend's friend. It's a matter
of course over here."</p>

<p>"Well, I don't consider it a matter of course
at all. I think it extraordinary, and it was so
very nice in Geoff to send word to Lion."</p>

<p>Then they parted. Meanwhile the little
room-mate had been having a private conference
with her "young man." She now
joined Imogen.</p>

<p>"Karl says we shall be married directly,
in a church, in half an hour," she told her.
"And oh, won't you and Mr. Young come
to be with us? It is so sad not to have one
friend when one is married."</p>

<p>It was impossible to refuse this request; so
it happened that the very first thing Imogen
did in America was to attend a wedding. It
took place in an old church, pretty far down
town; and she always afterward carried in
her mind the picture of it, dim and sombre
in coloring, with the afternoon sun pouring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
in through a rich rose window and throwing
blue and red reflections on the little group
of five at the altar, while from outside came
the din of wheels and the unceasing tread of
busy feet. The service was soon over, the signatures
were made, and the little bride went
down the chancel on her husband's arm, with
her face appropriately turned to the west, and
with such a look of secure and unfearing happiness
upon it as was good to see. It was an
unusual and typical scene with which to begin
life in a new country, and Imogen liked to
think afterward that she had been there.</p>

<p>Then followed a long drive up town over
rough ill-laid pavements, through dirty streets,
varied by dirtier streets, and farther up, by
those that were less dirty. Imogen had never
seen anything so shabby as the poorest of
the buildings that they passed, and certainly
never anything quite so fine as the best of
them. Squalor and splendor jostled each
other side by side; everywhere there was the
same endless throng of hurrying people, and
everywhere the same abundance of flowers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
for sale, in pots, in baskets, in bunches, making
the whole air of the streets sweet. Then
they came to the hotel, and were shown to
their rooms,&mdash;high up, airy, and nicely furnished,
though Imogen was at first disposed
to cavil at the absence of bed-curtains.</p>

<p>"It looks so bare," she complained. "At
home such a thing would be considered very
odd, very odd indeed. Fancy a bed without
curtains!"</p>

<p>"After you've spent one hot night in
America you'll be glad enough to fancy it,"
replied her brother. "Stuffy old things. It's
only in cold weather that one could endure
them over here."</p>

<p>The first few hours on shore after a voyage
have a delightfulness all their own. It is so
pleasant to bathe and dress without having
to hold on and guard against lurches and tips.
Imogen went about her toilet well-pleased;
and her pleasure was presently increased
when she found on her dressing-table a beautiful
bunch of summer roses, with "Mrs. Geoffrey
Templestowe's love and welcome" on a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
card lying beside it. Thoughtful Clover had
written to Ned Worthington to see to this
little attention, and the pleasure it gave went
even farther than she had hoped.</p>

<p>"I declare," said Imogen, sitting down
with the flowers before her, "I never knew
anybody so kind as they all are. I don't
feel half so home-sick as I expected. I must
write mamma about these roses. Of course
Mrs. Geoff does it for Isabel's sake; but all
the same it is awfully nice of her, and I shall
try not to forget it."</p>

<p>Then, when, after finishing her dressing,
she drew the blinds up and looked from the
windows, she gave a cry of sheer pleasure,
for there beneath was spread out a beautiful
wide distance of Park with feathery trees and
belts of shrubs, behind which the sun was
making ready to set in a crimson sky. There
was a balcony outside the windows, and Imogen
pulled a chair out on it to enjoy the
view. Carriages were rolling in at the Park
gates, looking exactly like the equipages one
sees in London, with fat coachmen, glossy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
horses, and jingling silvered harness. Girls
and young men were cantering along the
bridle-paths, and throngs of well-dressed people
filled the walks. Beyond was a fairy lake,
where gondolas shot to and fro; a band
was playing; from still farther away came a
peal of chimes from a church tower.</p>

<p>"And this is New York!" thought Imogen.
Then her thoughts reverted to Miss Opdyke
and her tale of the Tammany Indians, and she
flushed with sudden vexation.</p>

<p>"What an idiot she must have considered
me!" she reflected.</p>

<p>But her insular prejudices revived in full
force as a knock was heard, and a colored
boy, entering with a tinkling pitcher, inquired,
"Did you ring for ice-water, lady?"</p>

<p>"No!" said Imogen sharply; "I never
drink iced water. I rang for hot water, but I
got it more than an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, lady."</p>

<p>"Why on earth does he call me 'lady'?"
she murmured&mdash;"so tiresome and vulgar!"</p>

<p>Then Lionel came for her, and they went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
down to dinner,&mdash;a wonderful repast, with
soups and fishes and vegetables quite unknown
to her; a bewildering succession of
meats and entr&eacute;es, strawberries such as she
had supposed did not grow outside of England,
raspberries and currants such as England
never knew, and wonderful blackberries,
of great size and sweetness, bursting with purple
juice. There were ices too, served in the
shapes of apples, pears, and stalks of asparagus,
which dazzled her country eyes not a
little, while the whole was a terror and astonishment
to her thrifty English mind.</p>

<p>"Lionel, don't keep on ordering things
so," she protested. "We are eating our
heads off as it is, I am sure."</p>

<p>"My dear young friend, you are come to
the Land of Fat Things," he replied. "Dinner
costs just the same, once you sit down
to it, whether you have a biscuit and a glass
of water, or all these things."</p>

<p>"I call it a sinful waste, then," she retorted.
"But all the same, since it is so,
I'll take another ice."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>"'First endure, then pity, then embrace,'"
quoted her brother. "That's right, Moggy;
pitch in, spoil the Egyptians. It doesn't
hurt them, and it will do you lots of good."</p>

<p>From the dinner-table they went straight
to the theatre, having decided to follow Lieut.
Worthington's advice and see "Rip Van
Winkle." And then they straightway fell
under the spell of a magician who has enchanted
many thousands before them, and
for the space of two hours forgot themselves,
their hopes and fears and expectations, while
they followed the fortunes of the idle, lovable,
unpractical Rip, up the mountain to his
sleep of years, and down again, white-haired
and tottering, to find himself forgotten by his
kin and a stranger in his own home. People
about them were weeping on relays of
pocket-handkerchiefs, hanging them up one
by one as they became soaked, and beginning
on others. Imogen had but one handkerchief,
but she cried with that till she had
to borrow Lionel's; and he, though he professed
to be very stoical, could not quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
command his voice as he tried to chaff her in
a whisper on her emotions, and begged her
to "dry up" and remember that it was only
a play after all, and that presently Jefferson
would discard his white hair and wrinkles, go
home to a good supper, and make a jolly
end to the evening.</p>

<p>It was almost too exciting for a first night
on shore, and if Imogen had not been so
tired, and if her uncurtained bed had not
proved so deliciously comfortable, she would
scarcely have slept as she did till half-past
seven the next morning, so that they had to
scramble through breakfast not to lose their
train. Once started in the "Limited," with a
library and a lady's-maid, a bath and a bed
at her disposal, and just beyond a daintily appointed
dinner-table adorned with fresh flowers,&mdash;all
at forty miles an hour,&mdash;she had
leisure to review her situation and be astonished.
Bustling cities shot past them,&mdash;or
seemed to shoot,&mdash;beautifully kept country-seats,
shabby suburbs where goats and pigs
mounted guard over shanties and cabbage-beds,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
great tracts of wild forest, factory towns
black with smoke, rivers winding between
blue hill ridges, prairie-like expanses so overgrown
with wild-flowers that they looked all
pink or all blue,&mdash;everything by turns and
nothing long. It seemed the sequence of
the unexpected, a succession of rapidly changing
surprises, for which it was impossible to
prepare beforehand.</p>

<p>"I shall never learn to understand it,"
thought poor perplexed Imogen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>IN THE HIGH VALLEY.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/drop_m.png" width="100" height="100" alt="M" title="M" />
</div><div class='unindent'>EANWHILE, as the "Limited" bore
the young English travellers on
their western way, a good deal of
preparation was going on for their benefit in
that special nook of the Rocky mountains toward
which their course was directed. It
was one of those clear-cut, jewel-like mornings
which seem peculiar to Colorado, with
dazzling gold sunshine, a cloudless sky of deep
sapphire blue, and air which had touched the
mountain snows somewhere in its nightly
blowing, and still carried on its wings the
cool pure zest of the contact.</div>

<p>Hours were generally early in the High
Valley, but to-day they were a little earlier
than usual, for every one had a sense
of much to be done. Clover Templestowe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
did not always get up to administer to her
husband and brother-in-law their "stirrup-cup"
of coffee; but this morning she was
prompt at her post, and after watching them
ride up the valley, and standing for a moment
at the open door for a breath of the scented
wind, she seated herself at her sewing-machine.
A steady whirring hum presently
filled the room, rising to the floor above and
quickening the movements there. Elsie, running
rapidly downstairs half an hour later,
found her sister with quite a pile of little
cheese-cloth squares and oblongs folded on
the table near her.</p>

<p>"Dear me! are those the Youngs' curtains
you are doing?" she asked. "I fully meant
to get down early and finish my half. That
wretched little Phillida elected to wake up
and demand ''tories' from one o'clock till a
quarter past two. 'Hence these tears.' I
overslept myself without knowing it."</p>

<p>Phillida was Elsie's little girl, two years
and a half old now, and Dr. Carr's namesake.</p>

<p>"How bad of her!" said Clover, smiling.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
"I wish children could be born with a sense
of the fitness of times and seasons. Jeffy is
pretty good as to sleeping, but he is dreadful
about eating. Half the time he doesn't want
anything at dinner; and then at half-past
three, or a quarter to eight, or ten minutes
after twelve, or some such uncanonical
hour, he is so ragingly hungry that he can
scarcely wait till I fetch him something. He
is so tiresome about his bath too. Fancy a
young semi-Britain objecting to 'tub.' I've
circumvented him to-day, however, for Geoff
has promised to wash him while you and I
go up to set the new house in order. Baby
is always good with Geoff."</p>

<p>"So he is," remarked Elsie as she moved
about giving little tidying touches here and
there to books and furniture. "I never knew
a father and child who suited each other so
perfectly. Phil flirts with Clarence and he is
very proud of her notice, but I think they are
mutually rather shy; and he always touches
her as though she were a bit of eggshell
china, that he was afraid of breaking."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The room in which the sisters were talking
bore little resemblance to the bare ranch-parlor
of old days. It had been enlarged by
a semi-circular bay window toward the mountain
view, which made it half as long again as
it then was; and its ceiling had been raised
two feet on the occasion of Clarence's marriage,
when great improvements had been
undertaken to fit the "hut" for the occupation
of two families. The solid redwood
beams which supported the floor above had
been left bare, and lightly oiled to bring out
the pale russet-orange color of the wood.
The spaces between the beams were rough-plastered;
and on the decoration of this
plaster, while in a soft state, a good deal of
time had been expended by Geoffrey Templestowe,
who had developed a turn for household
art, and seemed to enjoy lying for hours
on his back on a staging, clad in pajamas and
indenting the plaster with rosettes and sunken
half-rounds, using a croquet ball and a butter
stamp alternately, the whole being subsequently
finished by a coat of dull gold paint.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
He and Clover had themselves hung the walls
with its pale orange-brown paper; a herder
with a turn for carpentry had laid the new
floor of narrow redwood boards. Clover had
stained the striped pattern along its edges.
In that remote spot, where trained and regular
assistance could be had only at great trouble
and expense, it was desirable that every one
should utilize whatever faculty or accomplishment
he or she possessed, and the result was
certainly good. The big, homelike room,
with its well-chosen colors and look of taste
and individuality, left nothing to be desired
in the way of comfort, and was far prettier
and more original than if ordered cut-and-dried
from some artist in effects, to whom its
doing would have been simply a job and not
an enjoyment.</p>

<p>Clover's wedding presents had furnished part
of the rugs and etchings and bits of china
which ornamented the room, but Elsie's, who
had married into a "present-giving connection,"
as her sister Johnnie called it, did even more.
Each sister was supposed to own a private<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
sitting-room, made out of the little sleeping-chambers
of what Clarence Page stigmatized
as the "beggarly bachelor days," which were
thrown together two in one on either side
the common room. Clover and Elsie had
taken pains and pleasure in making these
pretty and different from each other, but as
a matter of fact the "private" parlors were
not private at all; for the two families were
such very good friends that they generally
preferred to be together. And the rooms
were chiefly of use when the house was full
of guests, as in the summer it sometimes was,
when Johnnie had a girl or two staying with
her, or a young man with a tendency toward
corners, or when Dr. Carr wanted to escape
from his young people and analyze flowers at
leisure or read his newspaper in peace and
quiet.</p>

<p>The big room in the middle was used by
both families as a dining and sitting place.
Behind it another had been added, which
served as a sort of mixed library, office, dispensary,
and storage-room, and over the four,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
extending to the very edge of the wide verandas
which flanked the house on three sides,
were six large bedrooms. Of these each family
owned three, and they had an equal right
as well to the spare rooms in the building
which had once been the kitchen. One of
these, called "Phil's room," was kept as a
matter of course for the use of that young
gentleman, who, while nominally studying
law in an office at St. Helen's, contrived to
get out to the Valley very frequently. The
interests of the party were so identical that
the matter of ownership seldom came up,
and signified little. The sisters divided the
house-keeping between them amicably, one
supplementing the other; the improvements
were paid for out of a common purse; their
guests, being equally near and dear, belonged
equally to all. It was an ideal arrangement,
which one quick tongue or jealous or hasty
temper would have brought to speedy conclusion,
but which had now lasted to the
satisfaction of all parties concerned for nearly
four years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>That Clarence and Elsie should fancy
each other had been a secret though unconfessed
dream of Clover's ever since her own
engagement, when Clarence had endeared
himself by his manly behavior and real unselfishness
under trying circumstances. But
these dreams are rarely gratified, and she was
not at all prepared to have hers come true
with such unexpected ease and rapidity. It
happened on this wise. Six months after her
marriage, when she and Geoff and Clarence,
working together, had just got the "hut"
into a state to receive visitors, Mr. and Mrs.
Dayton, who had never forgotten or lost their
interest in their pretty fellow-traveller of two
years before, hearing from Mrs. Ashe how desirous
Clover was of a visit from her father
and sisters, wrote and asked the Carrs to go
out with them in car 47 as far as Denver, and
be picked up and brought back two months
later when the Daytons returned from Alaska.
The girls were wild to go, it seemed an opportunity
too good to be lost; so the invitation
was accepted, and, as sometimes happens, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
kindness shown had an unlooked-for return.
Mr. Dayton was seized with a sudden ill turn
on the journey, of a sort to which he was
subject, and Dr. Carr was able not only to
help him at the moment, but to suggest a
regimen and treatment which was of permanent
benefit to him. Doctor and patient grew
very fond of each other, and every year since,
when car 47 started on its western course, urgent
invitations came for any or all of them
to take advantage of it and go out to see
Clover; whereby that hospitable housekeeper
gained many visits which otherwise she would
never have had, Colorado journeys being expensive
luxuries.</p>

<p>But this is anticipating. No visit, they all
agreed, ever compared with that first one, when
they were so charmed to meet, and everything
was new and surprising and delightful.
The girls were enchanted with the Valley,
the climate, the wild fresh life, the riding, the
flowers, with Clover's little home made pretty
and convenient by such simple means,
while Dr. Carr revelled in the splendid air,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
which seemed to lift the burden of years
from his shoulders.</p>

<p>And presently began the excitement of
watching Clarence Page's rapid and successful
wooing of Elsie. No grass grew under his
feet this time, you may be sure. He fell in
love the very first evening, deeply and heartily,
and he lost no opportunity of letting Elsie
know his sentiments. There was no rival in his
way at the High Valley or elsewhere, and the
result seemed to follow as a matter of course.
They were engaged when the party went
back to Burnet, and married the following
spring, Mr. Dayton fitting up 47 with all
manner of sentimental and delightful appointments,
and sending the bride and bridegroom
out in it,&mdash;as a wedding present, he said, but
in truth the car was a repository of wedding
presents, for all the rugs and porti&egrave;res and
silken curtains and brass plaques and pretty
pottery with which it was adorned, and the
flower-stands and Japanese kakemonos, were
to disembark at St. Helen's and help to decorate
Elsie's new home. All went as was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
planned, and Clarence's life from that day to
this had been, as Clover mischievously told
him, one p&aelig;an of thanksgiving to her for refusing
him and opening the way to real happiness.
Elsie suited him to perfection. Everything
she said and did and suggested was
exactly to his mind, and as for looks, Clover
was dear and nice as could be, of course, and
pretty,&mdash;well, yes, people would undoubtedly
consider her a pretty little woman; but as for
any comparison between the two sisters, it
was quite out of the question! Elsie had so
decidedly the advantage in every point, including
that most important point of all, that
she preferred him to Geoff Templestowe and
loved him as heartily as he loved her. Happiness
and satisfied affection had a wonderfully
softening influence on Clarence, but it was
equally droll and delightful to Clover to see
how absolutely Elsie ruled, how the least
indication of her least finger availed to mould
Clarence to her will,&mdash;Clarence, who had
never yielded easily to any one else in the
whole course of his life!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>So the double life flowed smoothly on in
the High Valley, but not quite so happily at
Burnet, where Dr. Carr, bereft of four out of
his six children, was left to the companionship
of the steady Dorry, and what he was
pleased to call "a highly precarious tenure
of Miss Joanna." Miss Joanna was a good
deal more attractive than her father desired
her to be. He took gloomy views of the
situation, was disposed to snub any young
man who seemed to be casting glances toward
his last remaining treasure, and finally announced
that when Fate dealt her last and
final blow and carried off Johnnie, he should
give up the practice of medicine in Burnet,
and retire to the High Valley to live as physician
in ordinary to the community for the
rest of his days. This prospect was so alluring
to the married daughters that they turned at
once into the veriest match-makers and were
disposed to many Johnnie off immediately,&mdash;it
didn't much matter to whom, so long as
they could get possession of their father.
Johnnie resented these man&oelig;uvres highly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
and obstinately refused to "remove the impediment,"
declaring that self-sacrifice was
all very well, but she couldn't and wouldn't
see that it was her duty to go off and be content
with a dull anybody, merely for the
sake of giving papa up to that greedy Clover
and Elsie, who had everything in the world
already and yet were not content. She liked
to be at the head of the Burnet house and
rule with a rod of iron, and make Dorry mind
his <i>p</i>'s and <i>q</i>'s; it was much better fun than
marrying any one, and there she was determined
to stay, whatever they might say or
do. So matters stood at the present time, and
though Clover and Elsie still cherished little
private plans of their own, nothing, so far,
seemed likely to come of them.</p>

<p>Elsie had time to set the room in beautiful
order, and Clover had nearly finished her
hemming, before the sound of hoofs announced
the return of the two husbands from their
early ride. They came cantering down the
side pass, with appetites sharpened by exercise,
and quite ready for the breakfast which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Choo Loo presently brought in from the new
cooking-cabin, set a little one side out of
sight, in the shelter of the grove. Choo Loo
was still a fixture in the valley. He and his
methods were a puzzle and somewhat of a
distress to the order-loving Clover, who distrusted
not a little the ways and means of
his mysteriously conducted kitchen; but servants
were so hard to come by at the High
Valley, and Choo Loo was so steady and
faithful and his viands on the whole so good,
that she judged it wise to ask no questions
and not look too closely into affairs but just
take the goods the gods provided, and be
thankful that she had any cook at all. Choo
Loo was an amiable heathen also, and very
pleased to serve ladies, who appreciated his
attempts at decoration, for he had an eye for
effect and loved to make things pretty. Clover
understood this and never forgot to notice and
praise, which gratified Choo Loo, who had
found his bachelor employers in the old days
somewhat dull and unobservant in this respect.</p>

<p>"Missie like?" he asked this morning, indicating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
the wreath of wild cranberry vine
round the dish of chicken. Then he set a
mound of white raspberries in the middle of
the table, starred with gold-hearted brown
coreopsis, and asked again, "Missie like dat?"
pleased at Clover's answering nod and smile.
Noiselessly he came and went in his white-shod
feet, fetching in one dish after another,
and when all was done, making a sort of
dual salaam to the two ladies, and remarking
"Allee yeady now," after which he departed,
his pigtail swinging from side to side and
his blue cotton garments flapping in the wind
as he walked across to the cook-house.</p>

<p>Delicious breaths of roses and mignonette
floated in as the party gathered about the
breakfast table. They came from the flower-beds
just outside, which Clover sedulously
tended, watered, and defended from the roving
cattle, which showed a provoking preference
for heliotropes over penstamens whenever
they had a chance to get at them. Cows were
a great trial, she considered; and yet after
all they were the object of their lives in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Valley, their <i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>, and must be put
up with accordingly.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose the Youngs have landed
yet?" asked Elsie as she qualified her husband's
coffee with a dash of thick cream.</p>

<p>"They should have got in last night if the
steamer made her usual time. I dare say we
shall find a telegram at St. Helen's to-morrow
if we go in," answered her brother-in-law.</p>

<p>"Yes, or possibly Phil will ride out and
fetch it. He is always glad of an excuse to
come. I wonder what sort of girl Miss Young
is. You and Clover never have said much
about her."</p>

<p>"There isn't much to say. She's just an
ordinary sort of girl,&mdash;nice enough and all
that, not pretty."</p>

<p>"Oh, Geoff, that's not quite fair. She's
rather pretty, that is, she would be if she
were not stiff and shy and so very badly
dressed. I didn't get on very much with her
at Clovelly, but I dare say we shall like her
here; and when she limbers out and becomes
used to our ways, she'll make a nice
neighbor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>"Dear me, I hope so," remarked Elsie.
"It's really quite important what sort of a
girl Miss Young turns out to be. A stiff person
whom you had to see every day would
be horrid and spoil everything. The only
thing we need, the only possible improvement
to the High Valley, would be a few
more nice people, just two or three, with
pretty little houses, you know, dotted here
and there in the side canyons, whom we
could ride up to visit, and who would come
down to see us, and dine and play whist and
dance Virginia reels and 'Sally Waters' on
Christmas Eve. That would be quite perfect.
But I suppose it won't happen till
nobody knows how long."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, too," said Geoff in a tone
of well-simulated sympathy. "Poor Elsie,
spoiling for people! Don't set your heart
on them. High Valley isn't at all a likely
spot to make a neighborhood of."</p>

<p>"A neighborhood! I should think not! A
neighborhood would be horrid. But if two
or three people wanted to come,&mdash;really nice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
ones, you know, perfect charmers,&mdash;surely
you and Clare wouldn't have the heart to
refuse to sell them building lots?"</p>

<p>"We are exactly a whist quartet now,"
said Clarence, patting his wife's shoulder.
"Cheer up, dear. You shall have your perfect
charmers <i>when</i> they apply; but meantime
changes are risky, and I am quite content
with things as they are, and am ready to
dance Sally Waters with you at any time
with pleasure. Might I have the honor now,
for instance?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, no! Clover and I have to work
like beavers on the Youngs' house. And,
Clare, <i>we</i> are quite a complete party in
ourselves, as you say; but there are the
children to be considered. Geoffy and Phillida
will want to play whist one of these
days, and where is <i>their</i> quartet to come
from?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 332px;">
<img src="images/illus02.png" width="332" height="374" alt="&quot;Down they came, hand in hand, chattering as they went.&quot;&mdash;Page 111" title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Down they came, hand in hand, chattering as they went.&quot;&mdash;Page 111</span>
</div>

<p>"We shall have to consider that point
when they are a little nearer the whist age.
Here they come now. I hear the nursery
door slam. They don't look particularly dejected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
about their future prospects, I must
say."</p>

<p>Four pairs of eyes turned expectantly toward
the staircase, down which there presently
came the dearest little pair of children
that can be imagined. Clover's boy of three
was as big as most people's boys of five, a
splendid sturdy little Englishman in build, but
with his mother's lovely eyes and skin. Phillida,
whose real name was Philippa, was of a
more delicate and slender make, with dark
brown eyes and a mane of ruddy gold which
repeated something of the tawny tints of her
father's hair and beard. Down they came
hand in hand, little Phil holding tightly to
the polished baluster, chattering as they went,
like two wood-thrushes. Neither of them had
ever known any other child playmates, and
they were devoted to each other and quite
happy together. Little Geoff from the first
had adopted a protecting attitude toward his
smaller cousin, and had borne himself like a
gallant little knight in the one adventure of
their lives, when a stray coyote, wandering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
near the house, showed his teeth to the two
babies, whose nurse had left them alone for a
moment, and Geoff, only two then, had caught
up a bit of a stick and thrown himself in
front of Phillida with such a rush and shout
that the beast turned and fled, before Roxy
and the collies could come to the rescue.
The dogs chased the coyote up the ravine
down which he had come, and he showed
himself no more; but Clover was so proud
of her boy's prowess that she never forgot the
exploit, and it passed into the family annals
for all time.</p>

<p>One wonderful stroke of good-luck had
befallen the young mothers in their mountain
solitude, and that was the possession of
Roxy and her mother Euphane. They were
sister and niece to good old Debby, who for
so many years had presided over Dr. Carr's
kitchen; and when they arrived one day in
Burnet fresh from the Isle of Man, and announced
that they had come out for good to
better their fortunes, Debby had at once
devoted them to the service of Clover and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Elsie. They proved the greatest possible
comfort and help to the High Valley household.
The place did not seem lonely to
them, used as they were to a still lonelier
cabin at the top of a steep moor up which
few people ever came. The Colorado wages
seemed riches, the liberal comfortable living
luxury to them, and they rooted and established
themselves, just as Debby had done,
into a position of trusted and affectionate
helpfulness, which seemed likely to endure.
Euphane was housemaid, Roxy nurse; it
already seemed as though life could never
have gone on without them, and Clover was
disposed to emulate Dr. Carr in objecting to
"followers," and in resenting any admiring
looks cast by herders at Roxy's rosy English
cheeks and pretty blue eyes.</p>

<p>Little Geoff ran to his father's knee, as a
matter of course, on arriving at the bottom of
the stairs, while Phillida climbed her mother's,
equally as a matter of course. Safely established
there, she began at once to flirt with
Clarence, making wide coquettish eyes at him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
smiling, and hiding her face to peep out and
smile again. He seized one of her dimpled
hands and kissed it. She instantly pulled it
away, and hid her face again.</p>

<p>"Fair Phillida flouts me," he said. "Doesn't
baby like papa a bit? Ah, well, he is going to
cry, then."</p>

<p>He buried his face in his napkin and sobbed
ostentatiously. Phillida, not at all impressed,
tugged bravely at the corner of the handkerchief;
but when the sobs continued and grew
louder, she began to look troubled, and leaning
forward suddenly, threw her arms round
her father's neck and laid her rose-leaf lips on
his forehead. He caught her up rapturously
and tossed her high in air, kissing her every
time she came down.</p>

<p>"You angel! you little angel! you little
dear!" he cried, with a positive dew of pleasure
in his eyes. "Elsie, what have we ever
done to deserve such a darling?"</p>

<p>"I really don't know what you have done,"
remarked Elsie, coolly; "but I have done a
good deal. I always was meritorious in my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
way, and deserve the best that is going, even
Phillida. She is none too good for me. Come
back, baby, to your exemplary parent."</p>

<p>She rose to recapture the child; but Clarence
threw a strong arm about her, still holding
Phillida on his shoulder, and the three
went waltzing merrily down the room, the
little one from her perch accenting the dance
time with a series of small shouts. Little
Geoff looked up soberly, with his mouth full
of raspberries, and remarked, "Aunty, I didn't
ever know that people danced at breakfast."</p>

<p>"No more did I," said Elsie, trying in vain
to get away from her pirouetting husband.</p>

<p>"No more does any one outside this extraordinary
valley of ours," laughed Geoff.
"Now, partner, if you have finished your fandango,
allow me to remind you that there are
a hundred and forty head of cattle waiting to
be branded in the upper valley, and that Manuel
is to meet us there at ten o'clock."</p>

<p>"And we have the breakfast things to wash,
and a whole world to do at the Youngs'," declared
Elsie, releasing herself with a final twirl.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
"Now, Clare dear, order Marigold and Summer-Savory,
please, to be brought down in half an
hour, and tell old Jos&eacute; that we want him to
help and scrub. No, young man, not another
turn. These sports are unseemly on such a
busy day as this. 'Dost thou not suspect my
place? dost thou not suspect my years?' as
the immortal W. would say. I am twenty-five,&mdash;nearly
twenty-six,&mdash;and am not to
be whisked about thus."</p>

<p>Everybody went everywhere on horseback
in the High Valley, and the gingham riding-skirts
and wide-brimmed hats hung always on
the antlers, ready to hand, beside water-proofs
and top-coats. Before long the sisters were
on their way, their saddle-pockets full of little
stores, baskets strapped behind them, and the
newly made curtains piled on their laps. The
distance was about a mile to the house which
Lionel Young and his sister were to inhabit.</p>

<p>It stood in a charming situation on the slope
of one of the side canyons, facing the high
range and backed by a hillside clothed with
pines. In build it was very much such a cabin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as the original hut had been,&mdash;six rooms, all
on one floor, the sixth being a kitchen. It
was newly completed, and sawdust and fresh
shavings were littered freely about the place.
Clover's first act was to light a fire in the
wide chimney for burning these up.</p>

<p>"It looks bare enough," she remarked,
sweeping away industriously. "But it will
be quite easy to make it pleasant if Imogen
Young has any faculty at that sort of thing.
I'm sure it's a great deal more promising
than the Hut was before Clarence and Geoff
and I took hold of it. See, Elsie,&mdash;this room
is done. I think Miss Young will choose it
for her bedroom, as it is rather the largest;
so you might tack up the dotted curtains
here while I sweep the other rooms. And
that convolvulus chintz is to cover her dress-pegs."</p>

<p>"What fun a house is!" observed Elsie a
moment or two later, between her hammer
strokes. "People who can get a carpenter
or upholsterer to help them at any minute
really lose a great deal of pleasure. I always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
adored baby-houses when I was little,
and this is the same thing grown up."</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied Clover, abstractedly,
as she threw a last dustpanful of chips
into the fire. "It <i>is</i> good fun, certainly; but
out here one has so much of it that sometimes
it comes under the suspicion of being
hard work. Now, when Jos&eacute; has the kitchen
windows washed it will all be pretty decent.
We can't undertake much beyond making
the first day or two more comfortable. Miss
Young will prefer to make her own plans
and arrangements; and I don't fancy she's
the sort of girl who will enjoy being too
much helped."</p>

<p>"Somehow I don't get quite an agreeable
idea of Miss Young from what you and Geoffrey
say of her. I do hope she isn't going
to make herself disagreeable."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'm sure she won't do that; but
there is a wide distance between not being
disagreeable and being agreeable. I didn't
mean to give you an unpleasant impression
of her. In fact, my recollections about her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
are rather indistinct. We didn't see a great
deal of her when we were at Clovelly, or perhaps
it was that Isabel and I were out so much
and there was so much coming and going."</p>

<p>"But are not she and Isabel very intimate?"</p>

<p>"I think so; but they are not a bit alike.
Isabel is delightful. I wish it were she who
was coming out. You would love her. Now,
my child, we must begin on the kitchen tins."</p>

<p>It was an all-day piece of work which they
had undertaken, and they had ordered dinner
late accordingly, and provided themselves
with a basket of sandwiches. By half-past five
all was fairly in order,&mdash;the windows washed,
the curtains up, kitchen utensils and china
unpacked and arranged, and the somewhat
scanty supply of furniture placed to the best
advantage.</p>

<p>"There! Robinson Crusoe would consider
himself in clover; and even Miss Young can
exist for a couple of days, I should think,"
said Elsie, standing back to note the effect of
the last curtain. "Lionel will have to go in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
to St. Helen's and get a lot of things out
before it will be really comfortable, though.
There come the boys now to ride home with
us. No, there is only one horse. Why, it is
Phil!"</p>

<p>Phil indeed it was, but such a different Phil
from the delicate boy whom Clover had taken
out to Colorado six years before. He was
now a broad-shouldered, muscular, athletic
young fellow, full of life and energy, and
showing no trace of the illness which at that
time seemed so menacing. He gave a shout
when he caught sight of his sisters, and
pushed his broncho to a gallop, waving a
handful of envelopes high in air.</p>

<p>"This despatch came last night for Geoff,"
he explained, dismounting, "and there were a
lot of letters besides, so I thought I'd better
bring them out. I left the newspapers and
the rest at the house, and fetched your share
on. Euphane told me where you two were. So
this is where the young Youngs are going
to live, is it?"</p>

<p>He stepped in at the door and took a critical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
survey of the interior, while Clover and
Elsie examined their letters.</p>

<p>"This telegram is for Geoff," explained
Clover. "The Youngs are here," and she
read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Safely landed. We reach Denver Thursday morning,
six-thirty.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Lionel Young</span>.<br />
</div></div>

<p>"So they will get here on Thursday afternoon.
It's lucky we came up to-day. My
letters are from Johnnie and Cecy Slack.
Johnnie says&mdash;"</p>

<p>She was interrupted by a joyful shriek
from Clover, who had torn open her letter
and was eagerly reading it.</p>

<p>"Oh, Elsie, Elsie, what do you think is going
to happen? The most enchanting thing!
Rose Red is coming out here in August!
She and Mr. Browne and R&ouml;slein! Was there
ever anything so nice in this world! Just
hear what she says:"&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class='right'>
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>, June 30.<br />
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My Ducky-Daddles and my dear Elsie girl</span>,&mdash;I
have something so wonderful to tell that I can
scarcely find words in which to tell it. A kind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
Providence <i>and</i> the A. T. and S. F. R. R. have
just decided that Deniston must go to New Mexico
early in August. This would not have been at all
delightful under ordinary circumstances, for it would
only have meant perspiration on his part and widowhood
on mine, but most fortunately, some angels
with a private car of their own have turned up, and
have asked all three of us to go out with them as
far as Santa F&eacute;. What <i>do</i> you think of that? It
is not the Daytons, who seem only to exist to carry
you to and fro from Burnet to Colorado free of expense,
this time, but another batch of angels who
have to do with the road,&mdash;name of Hopkinson.
I never set eyes on them, but they appear to my
imagination equipped with the largest kind of
wings, and nimbuses round their heads as big as
shade-hats.</p>

<p>I have always longed to get out somehow to your
Enchanted Valley, and see all your mysterious husbands
and babies, and find out for myself what the
charm is that makes you so wonderfully contented
there, so far from West Cedar Street and the other
centres of light and culture, but I never supposed
I could come unless I walked. But now I <i>am</i> coming!
I do hope none of you have the small-pox, or
pleuro-pneumonia, or the "foot-and-mouth disease"
(whatever that is), or any other of the ills to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
men and cattle are subject, and which will stand in
the way of the visit. Deniston, of course, will be
forced to go right through to Santa F&eacute;, but R&ouml;slein
and I are at your service if you like to have us.
We don't care for scenery, we don't want to see
Mexico or the Pacific coast, or the buried cities of
Central America, or the Zu&ntilde;i corn dance,&mdash;if
there is such a thing,&mdash;or any alkaline plains, or
pueblos, or buttes, or buffalo wallows; we only
want to see you, individually and collectively, and
the High Valley. May we come and stay a fortnight?
Deniston thinks he shall be gone at least
as long as that. We expect to leave Boston on the
31st of July. You will know what time we ought
to get to St. Helen's,&mdash;I don't, and I don't care, so
only we get there and find you at the station. Oh,
my dear Clovy, isn't it fun?</p>

<p>I have seen several of our old school-set lately,
Esther Dearborn for one. She is Mrs. Joseph P.
Allen now, as you know, and has come to live at
Chestnut Hill, quite close by. I had never seen her
since her marriage, nearly five years since, till the
other day, when she asked me out to lunch, and
introduced me to Mr. Joseph P., who seems a very
nice man, and also&mdash;now don't faint utterly, but
you will! to their seven children! He had two of
his own when they married, and they have had two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
pairs of twins since, and "a singleton," as they say
in whist. Such a houseful you never did see; but
the twins are lovely, and Esther looks very fat and
happy and well-to-do, and says she doesn't mind it
a bit, and sees more clearly every day that the thing
she was born for was to take the charge of a large
family. Her Joseph P. is very well off, too. I
should judge that they "could have cranberry sauce
every day and never feel the difference," which an
old cousin of my mother's, whom I dimly remember
as a part of my childhood, used to regard as representing
the high-water mark of wealth.</p>

<p>Mary Strothers has been in town lately, too. She
has only one child, a little girl, which seems miserably
few compared with Esther, but on the other
hand she has never been without neuralgia in the
face for one moment since she went to live in the
Hoosac Tunnel, she told me, so there are compensations.
She seems happy for all that, poor dear
Mary. Ellen Gray never has married at all, you
know. She goes into good works instead, girls'
Friendlies and all sorts of usefulnesses. I do admire
her so much, she is a standing reproach and
example to me. "Wish I were a better boy," as
your brother Dorry said in his journal.</p>

<p>Mother is well and my father, but the house
seems empty and lonely now. We can never get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
used to dear grandmamma's loss, and Sylvia is gone
too. She and Tom sailed for Europe in April, and
it makes a great difference having them away, even
for a summer. My brother-in-law is such a nice
fellow, I hope you will know him some day.</p>

<p>And all this time I have forgotten to tell you the
chief news of all, which is that I have seen Katy.
Deniston and I spent Sunday before last with her at
the Torpedo station. She has a cosey, funny little
house, one of a row of five or six, built on the spine,
so to speak, of a narrow, steep island, with a beautiful
view of Newport just across the water. It was
a superb day, all shimmery blue and gold, and we
spent most of our time sitting in a shady corner of
the piazza, and talking of the old times and of all
of you. I didn't know then of this enchanting
Western plan, or we should have had a great deal
more to talk about. The dear Katy looks very well
and handsome, and was perfectly dear, as she always
is, and she says the Newport climate suits
her to perfection. Your brother-in-law is a stunner!
I asked Katy if she wasn't going out to see
you soon, and she said not till Ned went to sea next
spring, then she should go for a long visit.</p>

<p>Write at once if we may come. I won't begin on
the subject of R&ouml;slein, whom you will never know,
she has grown so. She goes about saying rapturously,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
"I shall see little Geoff! I shall see Phillida!
I shall see Aunt Clovy! Perhaps I shall
ride on a horse!" You'll never have the heart
to disappoint her. My "milk teeth are chattering
with fright" at the idea of so much railroad, as one
of her books says, but for all that we are coming,
if you let us. Do let us!</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">Your own Rose Red.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>"Let them! I should think so," cried
Clover, with a little skip of rapture. "Dear,
dear Rose! Elsie, the nicest sort of things
do happen out here, don't they?"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

<h3>ARRIVAL.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE train from Denver was nearing
St. Helen's,&mdash;and Imogen Young
looked eagerly from the window for
a first sight of the place. Their journey had
been exhaustingly hot during its last stages,
the alkaline dust most trying, and they had
had a brief experience of a sand-storm on the
plains, which gave her a new idea as to what
wind and grit can accomplish in the way of
discomfort. She was very tired, and quite
disposed to be critical and unenthusiastic;
still she had been compelled to admit that the
run down from Denver lay over an interesting
country.</div>

<p>The town on its plateau was shining in full
sunshine, as it had done when Clover landed
there six years before, but its outlines had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
greatly changed with the increase of buildings.
The mountain range opposite was
darkly blue from the shadows of a heavy
thunder gust which was slowly rolling away
southward. The plains between were of
tawny yellow, but the belts of mesa above
showed the richest green, except where the
lines of alfalfa and grain were broken by
white patches of mentzelia and poppies. It
was wonderfully beautiful, but the town itself
looked so much larger than Imogen had
expected that she exclaimed with surprise:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why, Lion, it's a city! You said you
were bringing me out to live in the wilderness.
What made you tell such stories?
It looks bigger than Bideford."</p>

<p>"It looks larger than it did when I came
away," replied her brother. "Two, three,
six,&mdash;eight fine new houses on Monument
Avenue, by Jove, and any number off there
toward the north. You've no idea how these
Western places sprout and thrive, Moggy.
This isn't twenty years old yet."</p>

<p>"I can't believe it. You are imposing on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
me. And why on earth did you let me bring
out all those pins and things? There seem
to be any number of shops."</p>

<p>"I let you! Oh, I say, that is good! Why,
Moggy, don't you remember how I remonstrated
straight through your packing. Never
a bit would you listen to me, and here is the
result," pulling out a baggage memorandum
as he spoke, and reading aloud in a lugubrious
tone, "Extra weight of trunks, thirteen
dollars, fifty-two cents."</p>

<p>"Thirteen fifty," cried Imogen with a gasp.
"My gracious! why, that's nearly three
pounds! Lion! Lion! you ought to have
<i>made</i> me listen."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I did all I could in that way.
But cheer up! You'll want your pins yet.
You mustn't confound this place with High
Valley. That's sixteen miles off and hasn't
a shop."</p>

<p>The discussion was brought to end by
the stopping of the train. In another moment
Geoff Templestowe appeared at the
door.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hallo, Lion! glad to see you. Imogen,"
shaking hands warmly, "how are you?
Welcome to Colorado. I'm afraid you've
had a bad journey in this heat."</p>

<p>"It <i>has</i> been beastly. Poor Moggy's dead
beat, I'm afraid. Neither of us could sleep a
wink last night for the dust and sand. Well,
it's all well that ends well. We'll cool her off
in the valley. How is everything going on
there? Mrs. Templestowe all right, and Mrs.
Page, and the children? I declare," stretching
himself, "it's a blessing to get a breath
of good air again. There's nothing in the
world that can compare with Colorado."</p>

<p>A light carryall was waiting near the station,
whose top was little more than a fringed awning.
Into this Geoffrey helped Imogen, and
proceeded to settle her wraps and bags in
various seat boxes and pockets with which
the carriage was cleverly fitted up. It was
truly a carry-all and came and went continually
between the valley and St. Helen's.</p>

<p>"Now," he remarked as he stuffed in the
last parcel, "we will just stop long enough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to get the mail and some iced tea, which I
ordered as I came down, and then be off.
You'll find a cold chicken in that basket,
Lion. Clover was sure you'd need something,
and there's no time for a regular
meal if we are to get in before dark."</p>

<p>"Iced tea! what a queer idea!" said
Imogen.</p>

<p>"I forgot that you were not used to it.
We drink it a great deal here in summer.
Would you rather have some hot? I didn't
fancy that you would care for it, the day is
so warm; but we'll wait and have it made,
if you prefer."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I won't delay you," said Imogen,
rather grudgingly. She was disposed
to resent the iced tea as an American innovation,
but when she tried it she found herself,
to her own surprise, liking it very much.
"Only, why do they call it tea," she meditated.
"It's a great deal more like punch&mdash;all
lemon and things." But she had to own
that it was wonderfully refreshing.</p>

<p>The sun was blazing on the plain; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
after they began to wind up the pass a cool,
strong wind blew in their faces and the day
seemed suddenly delightful. The unfamiliar
flowers and shrubs, the strange rock forms
and colors, the occasional mountain glimpses,
interested Imogen so much that for a time
she forgot her fatigue. Then an irresistible
drowsiness seized her; the talk going on between
Geoffrey Templestowe and her brother,
about cows and feed and the prospect of the
autumn sales, became an indistinguishable
hum, and she went off into a series of sleeps
broken by brief wakings, when the carryall
bumped, or swayed heavily from side to side
on the steep inclines. From one of the
soundest of these naps she was roused by
her brother shaking her arm and calling,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Moggy, wake, wake up! We are here."</p>

<p>With a sharp thump of heart-beat she
started into full consciousness to find the
horses drawing up before a deep vine-hung
porch, on which stood a group of figures which
seemed to her confused senses a large party.
There was Elsie in a fresh white dress with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
pale green ribbons, Clarence Page, Phil Carr,
little Philippa in her nurse's arms, small Geoff
with his two collies at his side, and foremost
of all, ready to help her down, hospitable
little Clover, in lilac muslin, with a rose in
her belt and a face of welcome.</p>

<p>"How the Americans do love dress!" was
Imogen's instant thought,&mdash;an ungracious
one, and quite unwarranted by the circumstances.
Clover and Elsie kept themselves
neat and pretty from habit and instinct, but
the muslin gowns were neither new nor fashionable,
they had only the merit of being
fresh and becoming to their wearers.</p>

<p>"You poor child, how tired you must
be!" cried Clover, as she assisted Imogen
out of the carriage. "This is my sister,
Mrs. Page. Please take her directly to her
room, Elsie, while I order up some hot water.
She'll be glad of that first of all. Lion, I
won't take time to welcome you now. The
boys must care for you while I see after your
sister."</p>

<p>A big sponging-bath full of fresh water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
stood ready in the room to which Imogen
was conducted; the white bed was invitingly
"turned down;" there were fresh flowers on
the dressing-table, and a heap of soft cushions
on a roomy divan which filled the deep
recess of a range of low windows. The gay-flowered
paper on the walls ran up to the
peak of the ceiling, giving a tent-like effect.
Most of the furnishings were home-made.
The divan was nothing more or less than
a big packing-box nicely stuffed and upholstered;
the dressing-table, a construction of
pine boards covered and frilled with cretonne.
Clover had plaited the chintz round
the looking-glass and on the edges of the
book-shelves, while the picture-frames, the
corner-brackets, and the impromptu washstand
owed their existence to Geoff's cleverness
with tools. But the whole effect was
pretty and tasteful, and Imogen, as she went
on with her dressing, looked about her with
a somewhat reluctant admiration, which was
slightly tinctured with dismay.</p>

<p>"I suppose they got all these things out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
from the East," she reflected. "I couldn't
undertake them in our little cabin, I'm sure.
It's very nice, and really in very good taste,
but it must have cost a great deal. The
Americans don't think of <i>that</i>, however; and
I've always heard they have a great knack
at doing up their houses and making a
good show."</p>

<p>"Go straight to bed if you feel like it.
Don't think of coming down. We will send
you up some dinner," Clover had urged;
but Imogen, tired as she was, elected to go
down.</p>

<p>"I really mustn't give in to a little fatigue,"
she thought. "I have the honor of
England to sustain over here." So she heroically
put on her heavy tweed travelling-dress
again, and descended the stairs, to find
a bright little fire of pine-wood and cones
snapping and blazing on the hearth, and the
whole party gathered about it, waiting for
her and dinner.</p>

<p>"What an extraordinary climate!" she exclaimed
in a tone of astonishment. "Melting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
with heat at three, and here at a quarter past
seven you are sitting round a fire! It really
feels comfortable, too!"</p>

<p>"The changes <i>are</i> very sharp," said Geoff,
rising to give her his chair. "Such a daily
drop in temperature would make a sensation
in our good old Devonshire, would it not?
You see it comes from the high elevation.
We are nearly eight thousand feet above the
sea-level here; that is about twice as high
as the top of the highest mountain in the
United Kingdom."</p>

<p>"Fancy! I had no idea of it. Lionel did
say something about the elevation, but I
didn't clearly attend." She glanced about
the room, which was looking its best, with
the pink light of the shaded candles falling
on the white-spread table, and the flickering
fire making golden glows and gleams on
the ceiling. "How <i>did</i> you get all these
pretty things out here?" she suddenly demanded.</p>

<p>"Some came in wagons, and some just
'growed,'" explained Clover, merrily. "We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
will let you into our secrets gradually. Ah,
here comes dinner at last, and I am sure
we shall all be glad of it."</p>

<p>Choo Loo now entered with the soup-tureen,
a startling vision to Imogen, who
had never seen a Chinaman before in her
life.</p>

<p>"How very extraordinary!" she murmured
in an aside to Lionel. "He looks
like an absolute heathen. Are such things
usual here?"</p>

<p>"Very usual, I should say. Lots of them
about. That fellow has a Joss in his cabin,
and very likely a prayer-wheel; but he's a
capital cook. I wish we could have the luck
to happen on his brother or nephew for
ourselves."</p>

<p>"I don't, then," replied his scandalized sister.
"I can't feel that it is right to employ
such people in a Christian country. The
Americans have such lax notions!"</p>

<p>"Hold up a bit! What do you know about
their notions? Nothing at all."</p>

<p>"Come to dinner," said Clover's pleasant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
voice. "Geoff, Miss Young will sit next <ins title="Transcriber's Note: this word not present in original">to</ins> you.
Put a cushion behind her back, Clarence."</p>

<p>Dinner over, Imogen concluded that she
had upheld the honor of England quite as
long as was desirable, or in fact possible,
and gladly accepted permission to go at once
to bed. She was fairly tired out.</p>

<p>She woke wonderfully restored by nine
hours' solid sleep in that elastic and life-giving
atmosphere, and went downstairs to
find every one scattered to their different
tasks and avocations, except Elsie, who was
waiting to pour her coffee. Clover and Lionel
were gone to the new house, she explained,
and they were to follow them as soon as
Imogen had breakfasted.</p>

<p>Elsie's manner lacked its usual warmth
and ease. She had taken no fancy at all to
the stiff, awkward little English woman, in
whom her quick wits detected the lurking
tendency to cavil and criticise, and was discouraging
accordingly. Oddly enough, Imogen
liked this offish manner of Elsie's. She
set it down to a proper sense of decorum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
and <i>retenue</i>. "So different from the usual
American gush and making believe to be at
ease always with everybody," she thought;
and she made herself as agreeable as possible
to Elsie, whom she considered much
prettier than Clover, and in every way more
desirable. These impressions were doubtless
tinctured by the underlying jealousy from
which she had so long suffered, and which
still influenced her, though Isabel Templestowe
was now far away, and there was no
one at hand to be jealous about.</p>

<p>The two rode amicably up the valley together.</p>

<p>"There, that's your new home," said Elsie,
when they came in sight of the just finished
cabin. "Didn't Lionel choose a pretty site
for it? And you have a most beautiful view."</p>

<p>"Well, Moggy," cried her brother, hurrying
out to help her dismount, "here you are
at last. Mrs. Templestowe and I have made
you a fire and done all sorts of things. How
do you like the look of it? It's a decent
little place, isn't it? We must get Mrs. Templestowe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to put us up to some of her nice
little dodges about furniture and so on, such
as they have at the other house. She and
Mrs. Page have made it all tidy for us, and
put up lots of nice little curtains and things.
They must have worked awfully hard, too.
Wasn't it good of them?"</p>

<p>"Very," said Imogen, rather stiffly. "I'm
sure we're much obliged to you, Mrs. Templestowe.
I fear you have given yourself a
great deal of trouble."</p>

<p>The words were polite enough, but the
tone was distinctly repellent.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Clover, lightly. "It was
only fun to come up and arrange a little
beforehand. We were very glad to do it.
Now, Elsie, you and I will ride down, and
leave these new housekeepers to discuss their
plans in peace. Dinner at six to-night, Lionel;
and please send old Jos&eacute; down if you
need anything. Don't stay too long or get
too tired, Miss Young. We shall have lunch
about one; but if you are doing anything
and don't want to leave so early, you'll find<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
some sardines and jam and a tin of biscuits
in that cupboard by the fire."</p>

<p>She and Elsie rode away accordingly.
When they were out of hearing, Clover remarked,&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wonder why that girl dislikes me so."</p>

<p>"Dislikes you! Clover, what do you mean?
Nobody ever disliked you in your life, or ever
could."</p>

<p>"Yes, she does," persisted Clover. "She
has got some sort of queer twist in her mind
regarding me, and I can't think what it is.
It doesn't really matter, and very likely she'll
get over it presently; but I'm sorry about
it. It would be so pleasant all to be good
friends together up here, where there are so
few of us."</p>

<p>Her tone was a little pathetic. Clover was
used to being liked.</p>

<p>"Little wretch!" cried Elsie, with flashing
eyes. "If I really thought that she dared
not to like you, I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;, well, what
would I do?&mdash;import a grisly bear to eat
her, or some such thing! I suppose an Indian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
could be found who for a consideration would
undertake to scalp Miss Imogen Young, and
if she doesn't behave herself he <i>shall</i> be found.
But you're all mistaken, Clovy; you must
be. She's only stiff and dull and horribly
English, and very tired after her journey.
She'll be all right in a day or two. If she
isn't, I shall 'go for' her without mercy."</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps it is that." It was easier
and pleasanter to imagine Imogen tired than
to admit that she was absolutely unfriendly.</p>

<p>"After all," she added, "it's for Miss
Young's sake that I should regret it if it
were so, much more than for my own. I
have Geoff and you and Clare,&mdash;and papa
and Johnnie coming, and dear Rose Red,&mdash;all
of you are at my back; but she, poor thing,
has no one but Lionel to stand up for her. I
am on my own ground," drawing up her figure
with a pretty movement of pride, "and she is
a stranger in a strange land. So we won't
mind if she is stiff, Elsie dear, and just be as
nice as we can be to her, for it must be horrid
to be so far away from home and one's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
own people. We cannot be too patient and
considerate under such circumstances."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the moment they were out of
sight Lionel had turned upon his sister
sharply, and angrily.</p>

<p>"Moggy, what on earth do you mean by
speaking so to Mrs. Templestowe?"</p>

<p>"Speaking how? What did I say?" retorted
Imogen.</p>

<p>"You didn't <i>say</i> anything out of the common,
but your manner was most disagreeable.
If she hadn't been the best-tempered woman
in the world she would have resented it on
the spot. Here she, and all of them, have
been doing all they can to make ready for us,
giving us such a warm welcome too, treating
us as if we were their own kith and kin, and
you return it by putting on airs as if she
were intruding and interfering in our affairs.
I never was so ashamed of a member of my
own family before in my life."</p>

<p>"I can't imagine what you mean," protested
Imogen, not quite truthfully. "And you've
no call to speak to me so, Lionel, and tell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
me I am rude, just because I don't gush and
go about making cordial speeches like these
Americans of yours. I'm sure I said everything
that was proper to Mrs. Templestowe."</p>

<p>"Your words were proper enough, but
your manner was eminently improper. Now,
Moggy," changing his tone, "listen to me.
Let us look the thing squarely in the face.
You've come out here with me, and it's awfully
good of you and I sha'n't ever forget it;
but here we are, settled for years to come in
this little valley, with the Templestowes and
Pages for our only neighbors. They can be
excellent friends, as I've found, and they are
prepared to be equally friendly to you; but if
you're going to start with a little grudge
against Mrs. Geoff,&mdash;who's the best little
woman going, by Jove, and the kindest,&mdash;you'll
set the whole family against us, and
we might as well pack up our traps at once
and go back to England. Now I put it to
you reasonably; is it worth while to upset all
our plans and all my hopes,&mdash;and for what?
Mrs. Templestowe can't have done anything
to set you against her?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"Lion," cried Imogen, bursting into tears,
"don't! I'm sure I didn't mean to be rude.
Mrs. Geoff never did anything to displease
me, and certainly I haven't a grudge against
her. But I'm very tired, so please don't s-c-o-ld
me; I've got no one out here but you."</p>

<p>Lionel melted at once. He had never seen
his sister cry before, and felt that he must
have been harsh and unkind.</p>

<p>"I'm a brute," he exclaimed. "There,
Moggy, there, dear&mdash;don't cry. Of course
you're tired; I ought to have thought of it
before."</p>

<p>He petted and consoled her, and Imogen,
who was really spent and weary, found the
process so agreeable that she prolonged her
tears a little. At last she suffered herself to
be comforted, dried her eyes, grew cheerful,
and the two proceeded to make an investigation
of the premises, deciding what should go
there and what here, and what it was requisite
to get from St. Helen's. Imogen had to
own that the ladies of the Valley had been
both thoughtful and helpful.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll thank them again this evening and
do it better," she said; and Lionel patted her
back, and told her she really was quite a little
brick when she wasn't a big goose,&mdash;a
brotherly compliment which was more gratifying
than it sounded.</p>

<p>It was decided that he should go into St.
Helen's next day to order out stores and
what Lionel called "a few sticks" that were
essential, and procure a servant.</p>

<p>"Then we can move in the next day,"
said Imogen. "I feel in such a hurry to begin
house-keeping, Lionel, you can't think.
One is always a stranger in the land till
one has a place of one's own. Geoff and his
wife are very kind and polite, but it's much
better we should start for ourselves as soon
as possible. Besides, there are other people
coming to stay; Mrs. Page said so."</p>

<p>"Yes, but not for quite a bit yet, I fancy.
All the same, you are right, Moggy; and we'll
set up our own shebang as soon as it can be
managed. You'll feel twice as much at home
when you have a house of your own. I'll get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the mattresses and tables and chairs out by
Saturday, and fetch the slavey out with me
if I can find one."</p>

<p>"No Chinese need apply," said Imogen.
"Get me a Christian servant, whatever you
do, Lion. I can't bear that creature with the
pig-tail."</p>

<p>"I'll do my possible," said her brother, in
a doubtful tone; "but you'll come to pig-tails
yet and be thankful for them, or I miss
my guess."</p>

<p>"Never!"</p>

<p>Imogen remembered her promise. She was
studiously polite and grateful that evening,
and exerted herself to talk and undo the unpleasant
impression of the morning. The little
party round the dinner-table waxed merry,
especially when Imogen, under the effect of
her gracious resolves, attempted to adapt her
conversation to her company and gratify her
hosts by using American expressions.</p>

<p>"People absquatulate from St. Helen's
toward autumn, don't they?" she remarked.
Then when some one laughed she added, "You
say 'absquatulate' over here, don't you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I don't know. I never did hear any
one say it except as a joke," replied Elsie.</p>

<p>And again: "Mother would be astonished,
Lion, wouldn't she, if she knew that a Chinese
can make English puddings as well as
the cooks at home. She'd be all struck of
a heap."</p>

<p>And later: "It really was dreadful. The
train was broken all to bits, and nearly every
one on board was hurt,&mdash;catawampously
chawed up in fact, as you Americans would
say. Why, what are you all laughing at?
Don't you say it?"</p>

<p>"Never, except in the comic newspapers and
dime novels," said Geoffrey Templestowe when
he recovered from his amusement, while Lionel,
utterly overcome with his sister's vocabulary,
choked and strangled, and finally found
voice to say,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Go on, Moggy. You're doing beautifully.
Nothing like acquiring the native dialect to
make a favorable impression in a new country.
Oh, wherever <i>did</i> she learn 'catawampus'?
I shall die of it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>UNEXPECTED.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/drop_i.png" width="98" height="100" alt="I" title="I" />
</div><div class='unindent'>MOGEN'S race-prejudices experienced
a weakening after Lionel's return
from St. Helen's with the only "slavey"
attainable, in the shape of an untidy,
middle-aged Irish woman, with red hair, and
a hot little spark of temper glowing in either
eye. Putting this unpromising female in
possession of the fresh, clean kitchen of the
cabin was a trial, but it had to be done; and
the young mistress, with all the ardor of inexperience,
bent herself to the task of reformation
and improvement, and teaching Katty
Maloney&mdash;who was old enough to be her
mother&mdash;a great many desirable things
which she herself did not very well understand.
It was thankless work and resulted
as such experiments usually do. Katty gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
warning at the end of a week, affirming that
she wasn't going to be hectored and driven
round by a bit of a miss, who didn't well
know what she wanted; and that the Valley
was that lonesome anyhow that she'd not
remain in it; no, not if the Saints themselves
came down from glory and kivered up every
fut of soil with shining gold, and she a-starving
in the mud,&mdash;that she wouldn't!</div>

<p>Imogen saw her go with small regret. She
had no idea how difficult it might be to find
a successor, and it was not till three incompetents
of the same nationality had been
lured out by the promise of high wages, only
to decide that the place was too "lonely" for
them and incontinently depart, that she realized
how hard was the problem of "help" in
such a place. It was her first trial at independent
housekeeping, and with her English
ideas she had counted on neatness, respectfulness
of manner, and a certain amount of training
as a matter of course in a servant. One
has to learn one's way in a new country by
the hardest, and perhaps, the least hard part<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of Imogen's lesson were the intervals when
she and Lionel did the work themselves, with
only old Jos&eacute; to scrub and wash up; then at
least they could be quiet and at peace, without
daily controversies. Later, relief and comfort
came to them in the shape of a gentle Mongolian
named Ah Lee, procured through the good
offices of Choo Loo, whom Imogen was only
too thankful to accept, pig-tail and all, for his
gentleness of manner, general neatness and
capacity, and the good taste which he gave to
his dishes. In fact, she confessed one day to
Lionel, privately in a moment of confidence,
that rather than lose him, she would herself
carve a joss stick and nail it up in the kitchen;
which concession proves the liberalizing and
widening effect of necessity upon the human
mind. But this is anticipating.</p>

<p>The cabin was a pleasant place enough
when once fairly set in order. There was an
abundance of sunshine, fire-wood was plenty,
and so small a space was easily kept tidy.
Imogen, when she reviewed her resources,
realized how wise Lionel had been in recommending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
her to bring more ornamental
things and fewer articles of mere use, such as
tapes and buttons. Buttons and tapes were
easy enough to come by; but things to make
the house pretty were difficult to obtain and
cost a great deal. She made the most of her
few possessions, and supplied what was lacking
with wild flowers, which could be had in
any quantity for the picking. Lionel had
hunted a good deal during his first Colorado
years, and possessed quite a good supply of
fox, wolf, and bear skins. These did duty
for rugs on the floor. Elk and buffalo horns
fastened on the walls served as pegs on which
to hang whips and hats. Some gay Mexican
pots adorned the chimney-piece; it all looked
pretty enough and quite comfortable. Imogen
would fain have tried her hand at home-made
devices of the sort in which the ladies at
the lower house excelled, but somehow her
attempts turned out failures. She lacked
lightness of touch and originality of fancy,
and the results were apt to be what Elsie
privately stigmatized as "wapses of red<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
flannel and burlaps without form or comeliness,"
at which Lionel jeered, while visitors
discreetly averted their eyes lest they
should be forced to express an opinion concerning
them.</p>

<p>Imogen's views as to the character and
capacities of American women underwent
many modifications during that first summer
in the Valley. It seemed to her that Mrs.
Templestowe and her sister were equal to
any emergency however sudden and unexpected.
She was filled with daily wonder
over their knowledge of practical details, and
their extraordinary "handiness." If a herder
met with an accident they seemed to know
just what to do. If Choo Loo was taken with
a cramp or some odd Chinese disease without
a name, and laid aside for a day or two,
Clover not only nursed him but went into
the kitchen as a matter of course, and extemporized
a meal which was sufficiently satisfactory
for all concerned. If a guest arrived
unexpectedly they were not put out; if some
article of daily supply failed, they seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
always able to devise a substitute; and through
all and every contingency they managed to
look pretty and bright and gracious, and make
sunshine in the shadiest places.</p>

<p>Slowly, for Imogen's mind was not of the
quick working order, she took all this in, and
her respect for America and Americans rose
accordingly. She was forced to own that whatever
the rest of womankind in this extraordinary
new country might be, these particular
specimens were of a sort which any land, even
England, might be justly proud to claim.</p>

<p>"And with all they do, they contrive to
look so nice," she said to herself. "I can't
understand how they manage it. Their gowns
fit so well, and they always seem to have
just the right kind of thing to put on. It
is really wonderful, and it certainly isn't
because they think a great deal about it.
Before I came over I always imagined that
American women spent their time in reading
fashion magazines and talking over their
clothes. Mrs. Geoff and Mrs. Page certainly
don't do that. I don't often hear them speak<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
about dresses, or see them at work at them;
and both of them know a great deal more
about a house than I do, or any other English
girl I ever saw. Mrs. Geoff, and Mrs. Page
too, can make all sorts of things,&mdash;cakes and
puddings and muffins and even bread; and
they read a good deal as well. The Americans
are certainly a cleverer people than I
supposed."</p>

<p>The mile of distance between what Clarence
called "the Hut and the Hutlet"
counted for little, and a daily intercourse
went on, trending chiefly, it must be owned,
from the Hut to the Hutlet. Clover was
unwearied in small helps and kindnesses. If
Imogen were cookless, old Jos&eacute; was sure to
appear with a loaf of freshly baked bread, or a
basket of graham gems; or Geoff with a creel
of trout and an urgent invitation to lunch or
dinner or both. New books made their appearance
from below, newspapers and magazines;
and if ever the day came when Imogen
felt hopelessly faint-hearted, lonely, and
over-worked, she was sure to see the flutter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
of skirts, and her pretty, cordial neighbors
would come riding up the trail to cheer her,
and to propose something pleasant or helpful.
Sometimes Elsie would have her baby on her
knee, trusting to "Summer Savory's" sure-footed
steadiness; sometimes little Geoff
would be riding beside his mother on a
minute <i>burro</i>. Always it seemed as though
they brought the sun with them; and she
learned to watch for their coming on dull
days, as if they were in the secret of her
moods and knew just when they were most
wanted. But they came so often that these
coincidences were not so wonderful, after all.</p>

<p>Imogen did appreciate all this kindness,
and was grateful, and, after her manner,
responsive; still the process of what Elsie
termed "limbering out Miss Young" went
on but slowly. The English stock, firm-set
and sturdily rooted, does not "limber" readily,
and a bent toward prejudice is never
easily shaken. Compelled to admit that Clover
was worth liking, compelled to own her
good nature and friendliness, Imogen yet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
could not be cordially at ease with her.
Always an inward stiffness made itself apparent
when they were together, and always
Clover was aware of the fact. It made no
difference in her acts of good-will, but it
made some difference in the pleasure with
which she did them,&mdash;though on no account
would she have confessed it, especially to
Elsie, who was so comically ready to fire
up and offer battle if she suspected any one
of undervaluing her sister. So the month
of July went.</p>

<p>It was on the morning of the last day,
when the long summer had reached its
height of ripeness and completeness, and all
things seemed making themselves ready for
Rose Red, who was expected in three days
more, that Clover, sitting with her work on
the shaded western piazza, saw the unwonted
spectacle of a carriage slowly mounting the
steep road up the Valley. It was so unusual
to see any wheeled vehicle there, except
their own carryall, that it caused a
universal excitement. Elsie ran to the window<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
overhead with Phillida in her arms;
little Geoff stood on the porch staring out
of a pair of astonished eyes, and Clover came
forward to meet the new arrivals with an
unmistakable look of surprise in her face.
The gentleman who was driving and the
lady beside him were quite unknown to her;
but from the back part of the carriage a
head extended itself,&mdash;an elderly head, with
a bang of oddly frizzled gray hair and a
pair of watery blue eyes, all surmounted by
an eccentric shade hat, and all beaming and
twittering with recognition and excitement.
It took Clover a moment to disentangle her
ideas; then she perceived that it was Mrs.
Watson, who, when she and Phil first came
out to Colorado, years before, came with
them, and for a time had been one of the
chief trials and perplexities of their life there.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear, and I don't wonder that
you look astonished, for no one would suppose
that after all I went through with I
should ever again&mdash; This is my daughter,
and her husband, you know, and of course<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
their coming made it seem quite&mdash; We are
staying in the Ute Valley; only five miles
over, they said it was, but such miles! I'd
rather ride ten on a level, any day, as I told
Ellen, and&mdash;well, they said you were living
up here; and though the road was pretty
rough, it was possible to&mdash; And if ever
there was a man who could drive a buggy
up to the moon, as Ellen declares, Henry
is the&mdash;but really I was hardly prepared
for&mdash;but any way we started, and here
we are! What a wild sort of place it is
that you are living in, my dear Miss Carr&mdash;not
that I ought to call you Miss Carr,
for&mdash; I got your cards, of course, and
I was told then that&mdash; And your sister
marrying the other young man and coming
out to live here too! that must be very&mdash; Oh,
dear me! is that little boy yours? Well,
I never!"</p>

<p>"I am very glad to see you, I am sure,"
said Clover, taking the first opportunity of
a break in the torrent of words, "and Mrs.
Phillips too,&mdash;this is Mrs. Phillips, is it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
not? Let me help you out, Mrs. Watson,
and Geoffy dear, run round to the other
door and ask Euphane to send somebody to
take the horses."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Mrs. Phillips. "Let
me introduce my husband, Mrs. Templestowe.
We are at the hotel in the Ute Valley for
three days, and my mother wished so much
to drive over and see you that we have
brought her. What a beautiful place your
valley is!"</p>

<p>Mrs. Phillips, tall, large-featured, dark and
rather angular, with a pleasant, resolute face,
and clear-cut, rather incisive way of speaking,
offered as complete a contrast to her
pale, pudgy, incoherent little mother as could
well be imagined. Clover's instant thought
was, "Now I know what <i>Mr.</i> Watson must
have been like." Mr. Phillips was also tall,
with a keen, Roman-nosed face, and eye-glasses.
Both had the look of people who
knew what was what and had seen the
world,&mdash;just the sort of persons, it would
seem, to whom a parent like Mrs. Watson<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
would be a great trial; and it was the more
to their credit that they never seemed in
the least impatient, and were evidently devoted
to her comfort in all ways. If she
fretted them, as she undoubtedly must, they
gave no sign of it, and were outwardly all
affectionate consideration.</p>

<p>"Why, where is your little boy gone? I
wanted to see him," said Mrs. Watson, as
soon as she was safely out of the carriage.
"He was here just this moment, and then&mdash;I
must say you have got a beautiful situation;
and if mountains were all that one
needed to satisfy&mdash;but I recollect how you
used to go on about them at St. Helen's&mdash; Take
care, Ellen, your skirt is caught! Ah,
that's right! Miss Carr is always so&mdash;but
I mustn't call her that, I know, only I
never&mdash; And now, my dear, I must have
a kiss, after climbing up all this way; and
there were gopher holes&mdash;at least, a man
we met said they were that, and I really
thought&mdash; Tell me how you are, and all
about&mdash; That's right, Henry, take out the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
wraps; you never can tell how&mdash; Of course
Miss Carr's people are all&mdash; I keep calling
you Miss Carr; I really can't help it. What
a beautiful view!"</p>

<p>Clover now led the way in-doors. The
central room, large, cool, and flower-scented,
was a surprise to the Eastern guests, who
were not prepared to find anything so pretty
and tasteful in so remote a spot.</p>

<p>"This is really charming!" said Mr. Phillips,
glancing from fireplace to wall, and
from wall to window; while his wife exclaimed
with delight over the Mariposa lilies
which filled a glass bowl on the table, and
the tall sheaves of scarlet penstamens on
either side the hearth. Mrs. Watson blinked
about curiously, actually silent for a moment,
before her surprise took the form of
words.</p>

<p>"Why, how pretty it looks, doesn't it,
Ellen? and so large and spacious, and so
many&mdash; I'm all the more surprised because
when we were together before, you
wouldn't go to the Shoshone House, you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
remember, because it was so expensive, and
of course I&mdash; Well, circumstances <i>do</i> alter;
and it is a world of changes, as Dr. Billings
said in one of his sermons last spring. And
I'm sure I'm glad, only I wasn't prepared
to&mdash; Ellen! Ellen! look at that etching!
It's exactly the same as yours, which Jane
Phillips gave you and Henry for your tin
wedding. It was very expensive, I know,
for I was with her when she got it, and
so&mdash;at Doll's it was; and his things naturally&mdash;but
I really think the frame of this
is the handsomest! Now, my dear Miss Carr,
where <i>did</i> you get that?"</p>

<p>"It was one of <i>our</i> gifts," said Clover,
smiling. "There is a double supply of wedding
presents in this house, Mrs. Watson, for
my sister's are here as well as our own. So
we <i>are</i> rather rich in pretty things, as you
see, but not in anything else, except cows;
of those we have any number. Now, if you
will all excuse me for a moment, I will go
up and tell Mrs. Page that you are here."</p>

<p>Up she went, deliberately till she was out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of sight, and then at a swift, light run the
rest of the way.</p>

<p>"Elsie dear," she cried, bursting into the
nursery, "who do you think is here? Mrs.
Watson, our old woman of the Sea, you
know. She has her son-in-law and daughter
with her, and they look like rather nice people,
strange to say. They have driven over
from the Ute Valley, and of course they
must have some lunch; but as it happens it
is the worst day of the whole year for them
to choose, for I have sent Choo Loo into St.
Helen's to look up a Chinese cook for Imogen
Young, and I meant to starve you all on
poached eggs and raspberries for lunch. I
can't leave them of course, but will you just
run down, my darling duck, and see what
can be done, and tell Euphane? There are
cans of soup, of course, and sardines, and all
that, but I fear the bread supply is rather
short. I'll take Phillida. She's as neat as
a new pin, happily. Ah, here's Geoffy. Come
and have your hair brushed, boy."</p>

<p>She went down with one child in her arms<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and the other holding her hand,&mdash;a pretty
little picture for those below.</p>

<p>"My sister will come presently," she explained.
"This is her little girl. And here
is my son, Mrs. Watson."</p>

<p>"Dear me,&mdash;I had no idea he was such a
big child," said that lady. "Five years old,
is he, or six?&mdash;only three! Oh, yes, what
am I thinking about; of course he&mdash;Well,
my little man, and how do you like living up
here in this lonesome place?"</p>

<p>"Very much," replied little Geoff, backing
away from the questioner, as she aimlessly
reached out after him.</p>

<p>"He has never lived anywhere else," Clover
explained; "so he cannot make comparisons.
Ignorance is bliss, we are told,
Mrs. Watson."</p>

<p>Euphane, staid and respectable in her spotless
apron, now entered with the lunch-cloth,
and Clover convoyed her guests upstairs to
refresh themselves with cold water after the
dust of the drive. By the time they returned
the table was set, and presently Elsie appeared,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
cool and fresh in her pretty pink and white
gingham with a knot of rose-colored ribbon
in her wavy hair, her cheeks deepened to just
the becoming tint, the very picture of a dainty,
well-cared-for little lady. No one would have
suspected that during the last half-hour she
had stirred and baked a pan of brown "gems,"
mixed a cream mayonnaise for the lettuce, set
a glass dish of "junket" to form, and skimmed
two pans of cream, beside getting out the
soup and sweets for Euphane, and trimming
the dishes of fruit with kinnikinick and coreopsis.
The little feast seemed to have got
itself ready in some mysterious manner, without
trouble to any one, which is the last
added grace of any feast.</p>

<p>"It is perfectly charming here," said Mrs.
Phillips, more and more impressed. "I have
seen nothing at all like this at the West."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 318px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;No one would have suspected that she had skimmed two pans of cream&quot;&mdash;Page 166.</span>
</div>

<p>"There isn't any other place exactly like
our valley, I really think. Of course there
are other natural parks among the ranges
of the Rockies, but ours always seems to me
quite by itself. You see we lie so as to catch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
the sun, and it makes a great difference even
in the winter. We have done very little to
the Valley, beyond just making ourselves
comfortable."</p>

<p>"Very comfortable indeed, I should say."</p>

<p>"And so you married the other young man,
my dear?" Mrs. Watson was remarking to
Elsie. "I remember he used to come in very
often to call on your sister, and it was easy
enough to see,&mdash;people in boarding-houses
will notice such things of course, and we all
used to think&mdash; But there&mdash;of course she
knew all the time, and it is easy to make mistakes,
and I dare say it's all for the best as
it is. You look very young indeed to be married.
I wonder that your father could make
up his mind to let you."</p>

<p>"I am not young at all, I'm nearly twenty-six,"
replied Elsie, who always resented
remarks about her youth. "There are three
younger than I am in the family, and they
are all grown up."</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear, but you don't look it! You
don't seem a day over twenty. Ellen was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
nearly as old as you are before she ever met
Henry, and they were engaged nearly two&mdash; But
she never did look as young as most
of the girls she used to go with, and I suppose
that's the reason that now they are all
got on a little, she seems younger than&mdash; Well,
well! we never thought while I was
with your sister at St. Helen's, helping to take
care of your poor brother, you know, how it
would all turn out. There was a young man
who used to bring roses,&mdash;I forget his name,&mdash;and
one day Mrs. Gibson said&mdash; Her husband
had weak lungs and they came out to
Colorado on that account, but I believe he&mdash; They
were talking of building a house, and
I meant to ask&mdash; But there, I forgot; one
does grow so forgetful if one travels much
and sees a good many people; but as I was
saying&mdash;he got well, I think."</p>

<p>"Who, Mr. Gibson?" asked Elsie, quite
bewildered.</p>

<p>"Oh, no! not Mr. Gibson, of course. He
died, and Mrs. Gibson married again. Some
man she met out at St. Helen's, I believe it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
was, and I heard that her children didn't like
it; but he was rich, I believe and of course&mdash; Riches
have wings,&mdash;you know that proverb
of course,&mdash;but it makes a good deal of difference
whether they fly toward you or away
from you."</p>

<p>"Indeed it does," said Elsie, much amused.
"But you asked me if somebody got well.
Who was it?"</p>

<p>"Why, your brother of course. He didn't
die, did he?"</p>

<p>"Oh dear, no! He is living at St. Helen's
now, and perfectly well and strong."</p>

<p>"Well, that must be a great comfort to you
all. I never did think that he was as ill as
your sister fancied he was. Girls will get
anxious, and when people haven't had a
great deal of experience they&mdash; He used to
laugh a great deal too, and when people do
that it seems to me that their lungs&mdash; But of
course it was only natural at her age. I used
to cheer her up all I could and say&mdash; The air
is splendid there, of course, and the sun somehow
never seems to heat you up as it does at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the East, though it <i>is</i> hot, but I think when
people have weak chests they'd better&mdash; Dr.
Hope doesn't think so, I know, but after
all there are a great many doctors beside Dr.
Hope, and&mdash; Ellen quite agrees with me&mdash; What
was I saying."</p>

<p>Elsie wondered on what fragment of the
medley she would fix. She was destined
never to know, for just then came the trample
of hoofs and the "Boys" rode up to the door.</p>

<p>She went out on the porch to meet them
and break the news of the unexpected guests.</p>

<p>"That old thing!" cried Clarence, with unflattering
emphasis. "Oh, thunder! I thought
we were safe from that sort of bore up here.
I shall just cut down to the back and take a
bite in the barn."</p>

<p>"Indeed you will do nothing of the sort.
Do you suppose I came up to this place,
where company only arrives twice a year
or so, to be that lonesome thing a cowboy's
bride, that you might slip away and take
bites in barns? No sir&mdash;not at all. You
will please go upstairs, make yourself fit to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
be seen, and come down and be as polite as
possible. Do you hear, Clare?"</p>

<p>She hooked one white finger in his buttonhole,
and stood looking in his face with a
saucy gaze. Clarence yielded at once. His
small despot knew very well how to rule
him and to put down such short-lived attempts
at insubordination as he occasionally
indulged in.</p>

<p>"All right, Elsie, I'll go if I must.
They're not to stay the night, are they?"</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid! No indeed, they are going
back to the Ute Valley."</p>

<p>He vanished, and presently re-appeared to
conduct himself with the utmost decorum.
He did not even fidget when referred to
pointedly as "the other young man," by
Mrs. Watson, with an accompaniment of nods
and blinks and wreathed smiles which was, to
say the least, suggestive. Geoff's manners
could be trusted under all circumstances, and
the little meal passed off charmingly.</p>

<p>"Good-by," said Mrs. Watson, after she
was safely seated in the carriage, as Clover<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
sedulously tucked her wraps about her.
"It's really been a treat to see you. We
shall talk of it often, and I know Ellen will
say&mdash; Oh, thank you, Miss Carr, you always
were the kindest&mdash; Yes, I know it isn't Miss
Carr, and I ought to remember, but somehow&mdash; Good-by,
Mrs. Page. Somehow&mdash;it's
very pretty up here certainly, and you
have every comfort I'm sure, and you seem&mdash; But
it will be getting dark before long, and I
don't like the idea of leaving you young
things up here all by yourselves. Don't you
ever feel a little afraid in the evenings? I
suppose there are not any wild animals&mdash;though
I remember&mdash; But there, I mustn't
say anything to discourage you, since you
<i>are</i> here, and have got to stay."</p>

<p>"Yes, we have to stay," said Clover, as
she shook hands with Mr. Phillips, "and happily
it is just what we all like best to do."
She watched the carriage for a moment or
two as it bumped down the road, its brake
grinding sharply against the wheels, then she
turned to the others with a look of comically
real relief.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>"It seems like a bad dream! I had forgotten
how Phil and I used to feel when Mrs.
Watson went on like that, and she always did
go on like that. How did we stand her?"</p>

<p>"Ellen seems nice," remarked Elsie,&mdash;"Poor
Ellen!"</p>

<p>"Geoff," added Clarence, vindictively, "this
must not happen again. You and I must go
to work below and shave off the hill and
make it twice as steep! It will never do to
have the High Valley made easy of access to
old ladies from Boston who&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who call you 'the other young man,'"
put in naughty Elsie. "Never mind, Clare.
I share your feelings, but I don't think there
is any risk. There is only one of her, and I
am quite certain, from the scared look with
which she alluded to our 'wild beasts,' that
she never proposes to come again."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THORNS AND ROSES.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/drop_g.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="G" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>EOFF," said Clover as they sat at
dinner two days later, "couldn't
we start early when we go in to-morrow
to meet Rose, and have the morning
at St. Helen's? There are quite a lot of little
errands to be done, and it's a long time since
we saw Poppy or the Hopes."</div>

<p>"Just as early as you like," replied her
husband. "It's a free day, and I am quite
at your service."</p>

<p>So they breakfasted at a quarter before six,
and by a quarter past were on their way to
St. Helen's, passing, as Clover remarked,
through three zones of temperature; for it
was crisply cold when they set out, temperately
cool at the lower end of the Ute Pass,
and blazing hot on the sandy plain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>"We certainly do get a lot of climate for
our money out here," observed Geoff.</p>

<p>They reached the town a little before ten,
and went first of all to see Mrs. Marsh, for
whom Clover had brought a basket of fresh
eggs. She never entered that house without
being sharply carried back to former days,
and made to feel that the intervening time
was dreamy and unreal, so absolutely unchanged
was it. There was the rickety
piazza on which she and Phil had so often
sat, the bare, unhomelike parlor, the rocking-chairs
swinging all at once, timed as it were
to an accompaniment of coughs; but the
occupants were not the same. Many sets of
invalids had succeeded each other at Mrs.
Marsh's since those old days; still the general
effect was precisely similar.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh, who only was unchanged, gave
them a warm welcome. Grateful little Clover
never had forgotten the many kindnesses
shown to her and Phil, and requited them in
every way that was in her power. More than
once when Mrs. Marsh was poorly or overtired,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
she had carried her off to the High Valley
for a rest; and she never failed to pay her a
visit whenever she spent a day at St. Helen's.</p>

<p>Their next call was at the Hopes'. They
found Mrs. Hope darning stockings on the
back piazza which commanded a view of the
mountain range. She always claimed the entire
credit of Clover's match, declaring that
if she had not matronized her out to the
Valley and introduced her and Geoff to each
other, they would never have met. Her
droll airs of proprietorship over their
happiness were infinitely amusing to Clover.</p>

<p>"I <i>think</i> we should have got at each other
somehow, even if you had not been in existence,"
she told her friend; "marriages are
made in Heaven, as we all know. Nobody
could have prevented ours."</p>

<p>"My dear, that is just where you are mistaken.
Nothing is easier than to prevent
marriages. A mere straw will do it. Look
at the countless old maids all over the world;
and probably nearly every one of them came
within half an inch of perfect happiness, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
just missed it. No, depend upon it, there is
nothing like a wise, judicious, discriminating
friend at such junctures, to help matters
along. You may thank me that Geoff isn't
at this moment wedded to some stiff-necked
British maiden, and you eating your head
off in single-blessedness at Burnet."</p>

<p>"Rubbish!" said Clover. "Neither of us
is capable of it;" but Mrs. Hope stuck to
her convictions.</p>

<p>She was delighted to see them, as she always
was, and no less the bottle of beautiful
cream, the basket full of fresh lettuces, and
the bunch of Mariposa lilies which they had
brought. Clover never went into St. Helen's
empty-handed.</p>

<p>Here they took luncheon No. 1,&mdash;consisting
of sponge-cake and claret-cup, partaken
of while gazing across at Cheyenne Mountain,
which was at one of its most beautiful moments,
all aerial blue streaked with sharp sunshine
at the summit. It was the one defect
of the High Valley, Clover thought, that it
gave no glimpse of Cheyenne.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Luncheon No. 2 came a little later, with
Marian Chase, whom every one still called
"Poppy" from preference and long habit.
She was perfectly well now, but she and her
family had grown so fond of St. Helen's that
there was no longer any talk of their going
back to the East. She had just had some
beautiful California plums sent her by an admirer,
and insisted on Clover's eating them
with an accompaniment of biscuits and "natural
soda water."</p>

<p>"I want you and Alice Perham to come
out next week for two nights," said Clover,
while engaged in this agreeable occupation.
"My friend Mrs. Browne arrives to-day, and
she is by far the greatest treat we have ever
had to offer to any one since we lived in the
Valley. You will delight in her, I know.
Could you come on Monday in the stage to
the Ute Hotel, if we sent the carryall over
to meet you?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course. I never have any engagements
when a chance comes for going to
the dear Valley; and Alice has none, I am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
pretty sure. It will be perfectly delightful!
Clover, you are an angel,&mdash;'the Angel of
the Penstamen' I mean to call you," glancing
at the great sheaf of purple and white flowers
which Clover had brought. "It's a very
good name. As for Elsie, she is 'Our Lady
of Raspberries;' I never saw such beauties as
she fetched in week before last."</p>

<p>Some very multifarious shopping for the
two households followed, and by that time it
was two o'clock and they were quite ready for
luncheon No. 3,&mdash;soup and sandwiches, procured
at a restaurant. They were just coming
away when an open carriage passed them, silk-lined,
with a crest on the panel, jingling curb-chains,
and silver-plated harnesses, all after
the latest modern fashion, and drawn by a
pair of fine gray horses. Inside was a young
man, who returned a stiff bow to Clover's salutation,
and a gorgeously gowned young lady
with rather a handsome face.</p>

<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Thurber Wade, I declare,"
observed Geoffrey. "I heard that they were
expected."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Wade is so pleased to have
them come for the summer. We must go and
call some day, Geoff, when I happen to have
on my best bonnet. Do you think we ought
to ask them out to the Valley?"</p>

<p>"That's just as you please. I don't mind
if he doesn't. What fine horses. Aren't
you conscious of a little qualm of regret,
Clover?"</p>

<p>"What for? I don't know what you mean.
Don't be absurd," was all the reply he received,
or in fact deserved.</p>

<p>And now it was time to go to the train.
The minutes seemed long while they waited,
but presently came the well-known shriek and
rumble, and there was Rose herself, dimpled
and smiling at the window, looking not a whit
older than on the day of Katy's wedding
seven years before. There was little Rose too,
but she was by no means so unchanged as
her mother, and certainly no longer little,
surprisingly tall on the contrary, with her
golden hair grown brown and braided in a
pig-tail, actually a pig-tail. She had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
same bloom and serenity, however, and the
same sedate, investigating look in her eyes.
There was Mr. Browne too, but he was a
brief joy, for there was only time to shake
hands and exchange dates and promises of
return, before the train started and bore him
away toward Pueblo.</p>

<p>"Now," said Rose, who seemed quite unquenched
by her three days of travel, "don't
let's utter one word till we are in the carriage,
and then don't let's stop one moment
for two weeks."</p>

<p>"In the first place," she began, as the carryall,
mounting the hill, turned into Monument
Avenue, where numbers of new houses
had been built of late years, Queen Anne cottages
in brick and stone, timber, and concrete,
with here and there a more ambitious
"villa" of pink granite, all surrounded with
lawns and rosaries and vine-hung verandas
and tinkling fountains. "In the first place I
wish to learn where all these people and
houses come from. I was told that you lived
in a lodge in the wilderness, but though I see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
plenty of lodges the wilderness seems wanting.
Is this really an infant settlement?"</p>

<p>"It really is. That is, it hasn't come of
age yet, being not quite twenty-one years old.
Oh, you've no notion about our Western
towns, Rose. They're born and grown up
all in a minute, like Hercules strangling the
snakes in his cradle. I don't at all wonder
that you are surprised."</p>

<p>"'Surprised' doesn't express it. 'Flabbergasted,'
though low, comes nearer my meaning.
I have been breathless ever since we
left Albany. First there was that enormous
Chicago which knocked me all of a heap,
then Denver, then that enchanting ride over
the Divide, and now this! Never did I see
such flowers or such colored rocks, and never
did any one breathe such air. It sweeps all
the dust and fatigue out of one in a minute.
Boston seems quite small and dull in comparison,
doesn't it, R&ouml;slein?"</p>

<p>"It isn't so big, but I love it the most,"
replied that small person from the front seat,
where she sat soberly taking all things in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
"Mamma, Uncle Geoff says I may drive when
we get to the foot of a long hill we are just
coming to. You won't be afraid, will you?"</p>

<p>"N-o; not if Uncle Geoff will keep his eye
on the reins and stand ready to seize them if
the horses begin to run. Rose just expresses
my feelings," she continued; "but this is as
beautiful as it is big. What is the name of
that enchanting mountain over there,&mdash;Cheyenne?
Why, yes,&mdash;that is the one that you
used to write about in your letters when you
first came out, I remember. It never made
much impression on me,&mdash;mountains never
seem high in letters, somehow, but now I
don't wonder. It's the loveliest thing I ever
saw."</p>

<p>Clover was much pleased at Rose's appreciation
of her favorite mountain, and also with
the intelligent way in which she noted everything
they passed. Her eyes were as quick
as her tongue; chattering all the time, she
yet missed nothing of interest. The poppy-strewn
plain, the green levels of the mesa
delighted her; so did the wide stretches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
of blue distance, and she screamed with joy
at the orange and red pinnacles in Odin's
Garden.</p>

<p>"It is a land of wonders," she declared.
"When I think how all my life I have been
content to amble across the Common, and
down Winter Street to Hovey's, and now and
then by way of adventure take the car to the
Back Bay, and that I felt all the while as if I
were getting the cream and pick of everything,
I am astonished at my own stupidity. Rose,
are you not glad I did not let you catch
whooping cough from Margaret Lyon? you
were bent on doing it, you remember. If I
had given you your way we should not be
here now."</p>

<p>Rose only smiled in reply. She was used to
her little mother's vagaries and treated them
in general with an indulgent inattention.</p>

<p>The sun was quite gone from the ravines,
but still lingered on the snow-powdered peaks
above, when the carriage climbed the last steep
zigzag and drew up before the "Hut," whose
upper windows glinted with the waning light.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Rose looked about her and drew a long breath
of surprise and pleasure.</p>

<p>"It isn't a bit like what I thought it would
be," she said; "but it's heaps and heaps more
beautiful. I simply put it at the head of all
the places I ever saw." Then Elsie came running
on to the porch, and Rose jumped out
into her arms.</p>

<div class='poem'>
"I thank the goodness and the grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">That on my birth has smiled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And brought me to this blessed place</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">A happy Boston child!"</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>she cried, hugging Elsie rapturously. "You
dear thing! how well you look! and how
perfect it all is up here! And this is Mr.
Page, whom I have known all about ever
since the Hillsover days! and this is dear
little Geoff! Clover, his eyes are exactly
like yours! And where is <i>your</i> baby, Elsie?"</div>

<p>"Little wretch! she <i>would</i> go to sleep. I
told her you were coming, and I did all I
could, short of pinching, to keep her awake,&mdash;sang,
and repeated verses, and danced her
up and down, but it was all of no use. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
would put her knuckles in her eyes, and
whimper and fret, and at last I had to give
in. Babies are perfectly unmanageable when
they are sleepy."</p>

<p>"Most of us are. It's just as well. I can't
half take it in as it is. It is much better
to keep something for to-morrow. The drive
was perfect, and the Valley is twice as beautiful
as I expected it to be. And now I want
to go into the house."</p>

<p>Elsie had devoted her day to setting forth
the Hut to advantage. She and Roxy had
been to the very top of the East Canyon
for flowers, and returned loaded with spoil.
Bunches of coreopsis and vermilion-tipped
painter's-brush adorned the chimney-piece;
tall spikes of yucca rose from an Indian jar
in one corner of the room, and a splendid
sheaf of yellow columbines from another;
fresh kinnikinick was looped and wreathed
about the pictures; and on the dining-table
stood, most beautiful and fragile of all, a
bowlful of Mariposa lilies, their delicate, lilac-streaked
bells poised on stems so slender<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
that the fairy shapes seemed to float in air,
supported at their own sweet will. There
were roses, too, and fragrant little knots of
heliotrope and mignonette. With these Rose
was familiar; the wild flowers were all new
to her.</p>

<p>She ran from vase to vase in a rapture.
They could scarcely get her upstairs to
take off her things. Such a bright evening
followed! Clover declared that she had
not laughed so much in all the seven years
since they parted. Rose seemed to fit at
once and perfectly into the life of the place,
while at the same time she brought the
breath of her own more varied and different
life to freshen and widen it. They all
agreed that they had never had a visitor
who gave so much and enjoyed so much.
She and Geoffrey made friends at once,
greatly to Clover's delight, and Clarence
took to her in a manner astonishing to his
wife, for he was apt to eschew strangers,
and escape them when he could.</p>

<p>They all woke in the morning to a sense
of holiday.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"Boys," said Elsie at breakfast, "this isn't
at all a common, every-day day, and I don't
want to do every-day things in it. I want
something new and unusual to happen. Can't
you abjure those wretched beasts of yours for
once, and come with us to that sweet little
canyon at the far end of the Ute, where we
went the summer after I was married? We
want to show it to Rose, and the weather is
simply perfect."</p>

<p>"Yes, if you'll give us half an hour or so
to ride up and speak to Manuel."</p>

<p>"All right. It will take at least as long as
that to get ready."</p>

<p>So Choo Loo hastily broiled chickens and
filled bottles with coffee and cream; and by
half-past nine they were off, children and all,
some on horseback, and some in the carryall
with the baskets, to Elsie's "sweet little canyon,"
over which Pike's Peak rose in lonely
majesty like a sentinel at an outpost, and
where flowers grew so thickly that, as Rose
wrote her husband, "it was harder to find
the in-betweens than the blossoms." They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
came back, tired, hungry, and happy, just at
nightfall; so it was not till the second day
that Rose met the Youngs, about whom her
curiosity was considerably excited. It seemed
so odd, she said, to have "only neighbors,"
and it made them of so much consequence.</p>

<p>They had been asked to dinner to meet
Rose, which was a very formal and festive
invitation for the High Valley, though the
dinner must perforce be much as usual, and
the party was inevitably the same. Imogen
felt that it was an occasion, and wishing to
do credit to it, she unpacked a gown which
had not seen the light before since her arrival,
and which had done duty as a dinner
dress for two or three years at Bideford. It
was of light blue mousselaine-de-laine, made
with a "half-high top" and elbow sleeves,
and trimmed with cheap lace. A necklace
of round coral beads adorned her throat, and
a comb of the same material her hair, which
was done up in a series of wonderful loops
filleted with narrow blue ribbons. She carried
a pink fan. Lionel, who liked bright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
colors, was charmed at the effect; and altogether
she set out in good spirits for the
walk down the Pass, though she was prepared
to be afraid of Rose, of whose brilliancy
she had heard a little too much to
make the idea of meeting her quite comfortable.</p>

<p>The party had just gathered in the sitting-room
as they entered. Clover and Elsie were
in pretty cotton dresses, as usual, and Rose,
following their lead, had put on what at
home she would have considered a morning
gown, of linen lawn, white, with tiny bunches
of forget-me-nots scattered over it, and a
jabot of lace and blue ribbon. These toilettes
seemed unduly simple to Imogen, who
said within herself, complacently, "There is
one thing the Americans don't seem to understand,
and that is the difference between common
dressing and a regular dinner dress,"&mdash;preening
herself the while in the sky-blue
mousselaine-de-laine, and quite unconscious
that Rose was inwardly remarking, "My!
where <i>did</i> she get that gown? I never saw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
anything like it. It must have been made
for Mrs. Noah, some years before the ark.
And her hair! just the ark style, too, and
calculated to frighten the animals into good
behavior and obedience during the bad
weather. Well, I put it at the head of all
the extraordinary things I ever saw."</p>

<p>It is just as well, on the whole, that people
are not able to read each other's thoughts in
society.</p>

<p>"You've only just come to America, I
hear," said Rose, taking a chair near Imogen.
"Do you begin to feel at home yet?"</p>

<p>"Oh, pretty well for that. I don't fancy
that one ever gets to be quite at home anywhere
out of their own country. It's very
different over here from England, of course."</p>

<p>"Yes, but some parts of America are more
different than some other parts. You haven't
seen much of us as yet."</p>

<p>"No, but all the parts I have seen seemed
very much alike."</p>

<p>"The High Valley and New York, for
example."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, I wasn't thinking of New York. I
mean the plains and mountains and the Western
towns. We didn't stop at any of them,
of course; but seen from the railway they all
look pretty much the same,&mdash;wooden houses,
you know, and all that."</p>

<p>"What astonished us most was the distance,"
said Rose. "Of course we all learned
from our maps, when we were at school, just
how far it is across the continent; but I
never realized it in the least till I saw it.
It seemed so wonderful to go on day after
day and never get to the end!"</p>

<p>"Only about half-way to the end," put
in Clover. "That question of distance is a
great surprise; and if it perplexes you, Rose,
it isn't wonderful that it should perplex foreigners.
Do you recollect that Englishman,
Geoff, whom we met at the <i>table d'h&ocirc;te</i> at
Llanberis, when we were in Wales, and who
accounted for the Charleston earthquake by
saying that he supposed it had something to
do with those hot springs close by."</p>

<p>"What hot springs <i>did</i> he mean?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am sure you would never guess unless
I told you. The hot springs in the Yellowstone
Park, to be sure,&mdash;simply those, and
nothing more! And when I explained that
Charleston and the Yellowstone were about
as distant from each other as Siberia and
the place we were in, he only stared and
remarked, 'Oh, I think you must be mistaken.'"</p>

<p>"And are they so far apart, then?" asked
Imogen, innocently.</p>

<p>"Oh, Moggy, Moggy! what were your
geography teachers thinking about?" cried
her brother. "It seems sometimes as if
America were entirely left out of the maps
used in English schools."</p>

<p>"Lionel," said his sister, "how can you
say such things? It isn't so at all; but of
course we learned more about the important
countries." Imogen spoke quite artlessly;
she had no intention of being rude.</p>

<p>"Great Scott!" muttered Clarence under
his breath, while Rose flashed a look at
Clover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course," she said, sweetly, "Burmah
and Afghanistan and New Zealand and the
Congo States <i>would</i> naturally interest you
more,&mdash;large heathen populations to Christianize
and exterminate. There is nothing
like fire and sword to establish a bond."</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't mean that. Of course America
is much larger than those countries."</p>

<p>"'Plenty of us such as we are'" quoted
the wicked Rose.</p>

<p>"And pretty good what there is of us,"
added Clover, glad of the appearance of dinner
just then to create a diversion.</p>

<p>"That's quite a dreadful little person," remarked
Rose, as they stood at the doorway
two hours later, watching the guests walk up
the trail under the light of a glorious full
moon. "Her mind is just one inch across.
You keep falling off the edge and hurting
yourself. It's sad that she should be your
only neighbor. I don't seem to like her a bit,
and I predict that you will yet have some
dreadful sort of a row with her, Clovy."</p>

<p>"Indeed we shall not; nothing of the kind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
She's really a good little thing at bottom;
this angularity and stiffness that you object
to is chiefly manner. Wait till she has been
here long enough to learn the ways and wake
up, and you will like her."</p>

<p>"I'll wait," said Rose, dryly. "How
much time should you say would be necessary,
Clover? A hundred years? I should
think it would take at least as long as
that."</p>

<p>"Lionel's a dear fellow. We are all very
fond of him."</p>

<p>"I can understand your being fond of <i>him</i>
easily enough. Imogen! what a name for
just that kind of girl. 'Image' it ought to be.
What a figure of fun she was in that awful
blue gown!"</p>

<p>The two weeks of Rose's visit sped only
too rapidly. There was so much that they
wanted to show her, and there were so many
people whom they wanted her to see, and so
many people who, as soon as they saw her, became
urgent that she should do this and that
with them, that life soon became a tangle of impossibilities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
Rose was one of those charmers
that cannot be hid. She had been a belle all
her days, and she would be so till she died
of old age, as Elsie told her. Her friends of
the High Valley gloried in her success; but
all the time they had a private longing to
keep her more to themselves, as one retires
with two or three to enjoy a choice dainty of
which there is not enough to go round in a
larger company. They took her to the Cheyenne
Canyons and the top of Pike's Peak;
they carried her over the Marshall Pass and
to many smaller places less known to fame,
but no less charming in their way. Invitations
poured in from St. Helen's, to lunch, to
dinner, to afternoon teas; but of these Rose
would none. She could lunch and dine in
Boston, she declared, but she might never
come to Colorado again, and what she thirsted
for was canyons, and not less than one a day
would content her insatiable appetite for
them.</p>

<p>But though she would not go to St. Helen's,
St. Helen's in a measure came to her. Marian<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Chase and Alice made their promised visit;
Dr. and Mrs. Hope came out more than once,
and Phil continually; while smart Bostonians
whom Clover had never heard of turned up at
Canyon Creek and the Ute Valley and drove
over to call, having heard that Mrs. Deniston
Browne was staying there. The High
Valley became used to the roll of wheels and
the tramp of horses' feet, and for the moment
seemed a sociable, accessible sort of place to
which it was a matter of course that people
should repair. It was oddly different from
the customary order of things, but the change
was enlivening, and everybody enjoyed it
with one exception.</p>

<p>This exception was Imogen Young. She
was urged to join some of the excursions
made by her friends below, but on one excuse
or another she refused. She felt shy
and left out where all the rest were so well-acquainted
and so thoroughly at ease, and
preferred to remain at home; but all the
same, to have the others so gay and busy
gave her a sense of loneliness and separation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
which was painful to bear. Clover tried more
than once to persuade her out of her solitary
mood; but she was too much occupied
herself and too absorbed to take much time
for coaxing a reluctant guest, and the others
dispensed with her company quite easily; in
fact, they were too busy to notice her absence
much or ask questions. So the fortnight,
which passed so quickly and brilliantly at the
Hut, and was always afterward alluded to as
"that delightful time when Rose was here,"
was anything but delightful at the "Hutlet,"
where poor Imogen sat homesick and forlorn,
feeling left alone on one side of all the pleasant
things, scarcely realizing that it was her
own choice and doing, and wishing herself
back in Devonshire.</p>

<p>"Lion seems quite taken up with these
new people and <i>that</i> Mrs. Browne," she reflected.
"He's always going off with them
to one place or another. I might as well be
back in Bideford for all the use I am to him."
This was unjust, for Lionel was anxious and
worried over his sister's depressed looks and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
indisposition to share in the pleasures that
were going on; but Imogen just then saw
things through a gloomy medium, and not
quite as they were. She felt dull and heavy-hearted,
and did not seem able to rouse herself
from her lassitude and weariness.</p>

<p>Out of the whole party no one was so perfectly
pleased with her surroundings as the
smaller Rose. Everything seemed to suit the
little maid exactly. She made a delightful
playfellow for the babies, telling them fairy
stories by the dozen, and teaching them new
games, and washing and dressing Phillida with
all the gravity and decorum of an old nurse.
They followed her about like two little dogs,
and never left her side for a moment if they
could possibly help it. All was fish that came
to her happy little net, whether it was playing
with little Geoff, going on excursions with
the elders, scrambling up the steep side-canyons
under Phil's escort in search of flowers
and curiosities, or riding sober old Marigold
to the Upper Valley as she was sometimes
allowed to do. The only cloud in her perfect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
satisfaction was that she must some day
go away.</p>

<p>"It won't be very pleasant when I get
back to Boston, and don't have anything to
do but just walk down Pinckney Street with
Mary Anne to school, and slide a little bit on
the Common when the snow comes and there
aren't any big boys about, will it, mamma?"
she said, disconsolately. "I sha'n't feel as if
that were a great deal, I think."</p>

<p>"I am afraid the High Valley is a poor
preparation for West Cedar Street," laughed
Rose. "It <i>will</i> seem a limited career to both
of us at first. But cheer up, Poppet; I'm
going to put you into a dancing-class this
winter, and very likely at Christmas-time
papa will treat us both to a Moral Drayma.
There <i>are</i> consolations, even in Boston."</p>

<p>"That 'even in Boston' is the greatest
compliment the High Valley ever received,"
said Clover, who happened to be within hearing.
"Such a moment will never come to it
again."</p>

<p>And now the last day came, as last days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
will. Mr. Browne returned from Mexico,
with forty-eight hours to spare for enjoyment,
which interval they employed in showing
him the two things that Rose loved most,&mdash;namely,
the High Valley from top to bottom,
and the North Cheyenne Canyon. The last
luncheon was taken at Mrs. Hope's, who had
collected a few choice spirits in honor of the
occasion, and then they all took the Roses to
the train, and sent them off loaded with fruit
and flowers.</p>

<p>"Miss Young was extraordinarily queer and
dismal last night," said Rose to Clover as they
stood a little aside from the rest on the platform.
"I can't quite see what ails her. She
looks thinner than when we came, and doesn't
seem to know how to smile; depend upon it
she's going to be ill, or something. I wish
you had a pleasanter neighbor,&mdash;especially
as she's likely to be the only one for some
time to come."</p>

<p>"Poor thing. I've neglected her of late,"
replied Clover, penitently. "I must make
up for it now that you are going away.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Really, I couldn't take my time for her while
you were here, Rosy."</p>

<p>"And I certainly couldn't let you. I should
have resented it highly if you had. Oh dear,&mdash;there's
that whistle. We really have got
to go. I hoped to the last that something
might happen to keep us another day. Oh
dear Clover,&mdash;I wish we lived nearer each
other. This country of ours is a great deal
too wide."</p>

<p>"Geoff," said Clover, as they slowly climbed
the hill, "I never felt before that the High
Valley was too far away from people, but
somehow I do to-night. It is quite terrible
to have Rose go, and to feel that I may not
see her again for years."</p>

<p>"Did you want to go with her?"</p>

<p>"And leave you? No, dearest. But I
am quite sure that there are no distances in
Heaven, and when we get there we shall find
that we all are to live next door to each other.
It will be part of the happiness."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so. Meanwhile I am thankful
that my happiness lives close to me now. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
don't have to wait till Heaven for that, which
is the reason perhaps that for some years past
Earth has seemed so very satisfactory to me."</p>

<p>"Geoff, what an uncommonly nice way
you have of putting things," said Clover,
nestling her head comfortably on his arm.
"On the whole I don't think the High Valley
is so <i>very</i> far away."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 99px;">
<img src="images/drop_h.png" width="99" height="100" alt="H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>AVE you seen Imogen Young to-day?"
was Clover's first question
on getting home.</div>

<p>"No. Lionel was in for a moment at noon,
and said she was preserving raspberries; so,
as I had a good deal to do, I did not go up.
Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, nothing in particular. I only wanted
to know. Well, here we are, left to ourselves
with not a Rose to our name. How we <i>shall</i>
miss them! There's a letter from Johnnie
for you by way of consolation."</p>

<p>But the letter did not prove in the least
consoling, for it was to break to them a piece
of disappointing news.</p>

<p>"The Daytons have given up their Western
trip," wrote Johnnie. "Mrs. Dayton's father<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
is very ill at Elberon; she has gone to him, and
there is almost no chance of their getting
away at all this summer. It really is a dreadful
disappointment, for we had set our hearts
on our visit, and papa had made all his arrangements
to be absent for six weeks,&mdash;which
you know is a thing not easily done, or
undone. Then Debby and Richard had been
promised a holiday, and Dorry was going in
a yacht with some friends to the Thousand
Islands. It all seemed so nicely settled, and
here comes this blow to unsettle it. Well,
<i>Dieu dispose</i>,&mdash;there is nothing for it but resignation,
and unpacking our hopes and ideas
and putting them back again in their usual
shelves and corners. We must make what
we can of the situation, and of course, it isn't
anything so very hard to have to pass the
summer in Burnet with papa; still I was that
wild with disappointment at the first, that I
actually went the length of suggesting that
we should go all the same, <i>and pay our own
travelling expenses</i>! You can judge from this
how desperate my state of mind must have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
been! Papa, as you may naturally suppose,
promptly vetoed the proposal as impossible,
and no doubt he was right. I am growing
gradually resigned to Fate now, but all the
same I cannot yet think of the blessed Valley
and all of you, and&mdash;and the happy time we
are <i>not</i> going to have, without feeling quite
like 'weeping a little weep.' How I wish that
we possessed a superfluous income!"</p>

<p>"Now," said Elsie, and her voice too sounded
as if a "little weep" were not far off, "isn't
that too bad? No papa this year, and no Johnnie.
I suppose we are spoiled, but the fact is,
I have grown to count on the Daytons and
their car as confidently as though they were
the early and the latter rain." Her arch little
face looked quite long and disconsolate.</p>

<p>"So have I," said Clover. "It doesn't bear
talking about, does it?"</p>

<p>She had been conscious of late of a great
longing after her father. She had counted
confidently on his visit, and the sense of disappointment
was bitter. She put away her
bonnet and folded her gloves with a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
sober face. A sort of disenchantment seemed
to have fallen on the Valley since the coming
of this bad news and the departure of Rose.</p>

<p>"This will never do," she told herself at
last, after standing some moments at the window
looking across at the peak through a blur
of tears,&mdash;"I <i>must</i> brace up and comfort Elsie."
But Elsie was not to be comforted all
at once, and the wheels of that evening drave
rather heavily.</p>

<p>Next morning, as soon as her usual tasks
were despatched, Clover ordered Marigold saddled
and started for the Youngs'. Rose's last
remarks had made her uneasy about Imogen,
and she remembered with compunction how
little she had seen of her for a fortnight past.</p>

<p>No one but Sholto, Lionel's great deerhound,
came out to meet her as she dismounted
at the door. His bark of welcome
brought Ah Lee from the back of the house.</p>

<p>"Missee not velly well, me thinkee," he
observed.</p>

<p>"Is Missy ill? Where is Mr. Young, then?"</p>

<p>"He go two hours ago to Uppey Valley.
Missee not sick then."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is she in her room?" asked Clover. "Tie
Marigold in the shade, please, and I will go in
and see her."</p>

<p>"All litee."</p>

<p>The bed-room door was closed, and Clover
tapped twice before she heard a languid
"Come in." Imogen was lying on the bed
in her morning-dress, with flushed cheeks and
tumbled hair. She looked at Clover with a
sort of perplexed surprise.</p>

<p>"My poor child, what is the matter? Have
you a bad headache?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think so, rather bad. I kept up
till Lion had had his breakfast, and then
everything seemed to go round, and I had
to come and lie down. So stupid of me!"
impatiently; "but I thought perhaps it
would pass off after a little."</p>

<p>"And has it?" asked Clover, pulling off
her gloves and taking Imogen's hand. It was
chilly rather than hot, but the pulse seemed
weak and quick. Clover began to feel anxious,
but did her best to hide it under a cheerful
demeanor lest she should startle Imogen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>"Were you quite well yesterday?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;that is, I wasn't ill. I had no
headache then, but I think I haven't been
quite right for some time back, and I tried
to do some raspberries and felt very tired.
I dare say it's only getting acclimated. I'm
really very strong. Nothing ever was the
matter with me at home."</p>

<p>"Now," said Clover, brightly, "I'll tell you
what you are going to do; and that is to put
on your wrapper, make yourself comfortable,
and take a long sleep. I have come to
spend the day, and I will give Lion his luncheon
and see to everything if only you will
lie still. A good rest would make you feel
better, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," said Imogen, doubtfully. She
was too miserable to object, and with a docility
foreign to her character submitted to
be undressed, to have her hair brushed and
knotted up, and a bandage of cold water and
eau de cologne laid on her forehead. This
passive compliance was so unlike her that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
Clover felt her anxieties increase. "Matters
must be serious," she reflected, "when Imogen
Young agrees meekly to any proposal
from anybody."</p>

<p>She settled her comfortably, shook up
the pillows, darkened the window, threw
a light shawl over her, and sat beside the
bed fanning gently till Imogen fell into a
troubled sleep. Then she stole softly away
and busied herself in washing the breakfast
things and putting the rooms to rights. The
young mistress of the house had evidently
felt unequal to her usual tasks, and everything
was left standing just as it was.</p>

<p>Clover was recalled by a cry from the bedroom,
and hurried back to find Imogen sitting
up, looking confused and startled.</p>

<p>"What is it? Is anything the matter?"
she demanded. Then, before Clover could
reply, she came to herself and understood.</p>

<p>"Oh, it is you," she said. "What a comfort!
I thought you were gone away."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I have no idea of going away.
I was just in the other room, straightening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
things out a little. It was settled that I was
to stay to lunch and keep Lionel company,
you remember."</p>

<p>"Ah, yes. It is very good of you, but I'm
afraid there isn't much for luncheon," sinking
back on her pillows again. "Ah Lee will
know. I don't seem able to think clearly
of anything." She sighed, and presently was
asleep again, or seemed to be so, and Clover
went back to her work.</p>

<p>So it went all day,&mdash;broken slumbers, confused
wakings, increasing fever, and occasional
moments of bewilderment. Clover was sure
that it was a serious illness, and sent Lionel
down with a note to say that either Geoff or
Clarence must go in at once and bring out
Dr. Hope, that she herself was a fixture at
the other house for the night at least, and
would like a number of things sent up, of
which she inclosed a list. This note threw
the family into a wild dismay. Life in the
High Valley was only meant for well people,
as Elsie had once admitted. Illness at once
made the disadvantages of so lonely and inaccessible<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
a place apparent,&mdash;with the doctor
sixteen miles distant, and no medicines or
other appliances of a sick-room to be had
short of St. Helen's.</p>

<p>Dr. Hope reached them late in the evening.
He pronounced that Imogen had an attack of
"mountain fever," a milder sort of typhoid
not uncommon in the higher elevations of
Colorado. He hoped it would be a light case,
gave full directions, and promised to send out
medicines and to come again in three days.
Then he departed, and Clover, as she watched
him ride down the trail, felt as a shipwrecked
mariner might, left alone on a desert island,&mdash;astray
and helpless, and quite at a loss as
to what first to do.</p>

<p>There were too many things to be done,
however, to allow of her long indulging this
feeling, and presently her wits cleared and
she was able to confront the task before her
with accustomed sense and steadiness. Imogen
could not be left alone, that was evident;
and it was equally evident that she herself
was the person who must stay with her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Elsie could not be spared from her baby, and
Geoffrey, beside being more especially interested
in the Youngs, would be far more amenable
and less refractory than Clarence at a
curtailment of his domestic privileges. So,
pluckily and reasonably, she "buckled to"
the work so plainly set for her, established
herself and her belongings in the spare
chamber, gathered the reins of the household
and the sick-room into her hands, and
began upon what she knew might prove to
be a long, hard bout of patience and vigilance,
resolved to do her best each day as
it came and let the next day take care of
itself, minding nothing, no fatigue or homesickness
or difficulty, if only Imogen could
be properly cared for and get well.</p>

<p>After the first day or two matters fell into
regular grooves. The attack proved a light
one, as the doctor had hoped. Imogen was
never actually in danger, but there was a
good deal of weakness and depression, occasional
wandering of mind, and always the low,
underlying fever, not easily detected save by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
the clinical thermometer. In her semi-delirious
moments she would ramble about
Bideford and the people there, or hold Clover's
hand tight, calling her "Isabel," and
imploring her not to like "Mrs. Geoff" better
than she liked her. It was the first glimpse
that Clover had ever caught of this unhappy
tinge of jealousy in Imogen's mind; it grieved
her, but it also explained some things that
had been perplexing, and she grew very pitiful
and tender over the poor girl, away
from home among strangers, and so ill and
desolate.</p>

<p>The most curious thing about it all was
the extraordinary preference which the patient
showed for Clover above all her other
nurses. If Euphane came to sit beside her,
or Elsie, or even Lionel, while Clover took a
rest, Imogen was manifestly uneasy and unhappy.
She never <i>said</i> that she missed Clover,
but lay watching the door with a strained,
expectant look, which melted into relief as
soon as Clover appeared. Then she would
feebly move her fingers to lay hold of Clover's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
hand, and holding it fast, would fall
asleep satisfied and content. It seemed as if
the sense of comfort which Clover's appearance
that first morning had given continued
when she was not quite herself, and influenced
her.</p>

<p>"It's queer how much better she likes you
than any of the rest of us," Lionel said one
day. Clover felt oddly pleased at this remark.
It was a new experience to be preferred
by Imogen Young, and she could not
but be gratified.</p>

<p>"Though very likely," she told herself,
"she will stiffen up again when she gets well;
so I must be prepared for it, and not mind
when it happens."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Imogen could not have been
better cared for anywhere than she was in
the High Valley. Clover had a natural aptitude
for nursing. She knew by instinct what
a sick person would like and dislike, what
would refresh and what weary, what must be
remembered and what avoided. Her inventive
faculties also came into full play under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the pressure of the little daily emergencies,
when exactly the thing wanted was sure not
to be at hand. It was quite wonderful how
she devised substitutes for all sorts of deficiencies.
Elsie, amazed at her cleverness, declared
herself sure that if Dr. Hope were to say that
a roc's egg was needful for Imogen's recovery,
Clover would reply, as a matter of course, "Certainly,&mdash;I
will send it up directly," and thereupon
proceed to concoct one out of materials
already in the house, which would answer as
well as the original article and do Imogen
just as much good. She cooked the nicest
little sick-room messes, giving them variety by
cunningly devised flavors, and she originated
cooling drinks out of sago and arrowroot and
tamarinds and fruit juices and ice, which Imogen
would take when she refused everything
else. Her lightness of touch and bright, equable
calmness were unfailing. Dr. Hope said
she would make the fortune of any ordinary
hospital, and that she was so evidently cut
out for a nurse that it seemed a clear subversion
of the plans of Providence that she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
should ever have married,&mdash;a speech for
which the doctor got little thanks from anybody,
for Clover declared that she hated hospitals
and sick folks, and never wanted to
nurse anybody but the people she loved best,
and then only when she couldn't help herself;
while Geoffrey treated the facetious physician
to the blackest of frowns, and privately confided
to Elsie that the doctor, good fellow that
he was, deserved a kicking, and he shouldn't
mind being the one to administer it.</p>

<p>By the end of a fortnight the fever was conquered,
and then began the slow process of
building up exhausted strength, and fanning
the dim spark of life once again into a generous
flame. This is apt to be the most trying
part of an illness to those who nurse; the
excitement of anxiety and danger being past,
the space between convalescence and complete
recovery seems very wide, and hard to bridge
over. Clover found it so. Imogen's strength
came back slowly; all her old vigor and decision
seemed lost; she was listless and despondent,
and needed to be coaxed and encouraged
and cheered as much as does an ailing child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not "stiffen," however, as Clover
had feared she might do; on the contrary, her
dependence upon her favorite nurse seemed
to increase, and on the days when she was
most languid and hopeless she clung most to
her. There was a wistful look in her eyes
as they followed Clover in her comings and
goings, and a new, tender tone in her voice
when she spoke to her; but she said little,
and after she was able to sit up just lay back
in her chair and gazed at the mountains in a
dreamy fashion for hours together.</p>

<p>"This will never do," Lionel declared.
"We must hearten her up somehow," which
he proceeded to do, after the blundering
fashion of the ordinary man, by a series of
thrilling anecdotes about cattle and their
vagaries, refractory cows who turned upon
their herders and "horned" them, and wild
steers who chased mounted men, overtook
and gored them; how Felipe was stampeded
and Pepe just escaped with his life. The result
of this "heartening," process was that
Imogen, in her weak state, conceived a horror<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of ranch work, and passed the hours of his
absence in a subdued agony of apprehension
concerning him. He was very surprised and
contrite when scolded by Clover.</p>

<p>"What shall I talk to her about, then?"
he demanded ruefully. "I can't bear to see
her sit so dull and silent. Poor Moggy! and
cattle are the only subjects of conversation
that we have up here."</p>

<p>"Talk about yourself and herself and the
funny things that happened when you were
little, and pet her all you can; but pray
don't allude to horned animals of any kind.
She's so quiet only because she is weak.
Presently we shall see her brighten."</p>

<p>And so they did. With the first breath of
autumn, full of cool sparkle and exhilaration,
Imogen began to rally. Color stole back to
her lips, vigor to her movements; each day
she could do a little and a little more. Her
first coming out to dinner was treated as a
grand event. She was placed in a cushioned
chair and served like a queen. Lionel was
in raptures at seeing her in her old place,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
at the head of the table, "better than new,"
as he asserted; and certainly Imogen had
never in her life been so pretty. They had
cut her long hair during the illness because
it was falling out so fast; the short rings
round her face were very becoming, the sunburn
of the summer had worn off and her
complexion was delicately fair. Clover had
dressed her in a loose jacket of pale-pink
flannel which Elsie had fitted and made for
her; it was trimmed with soft frills of lace,
and knots of ribbon, and Geoff had brought
up a half-opened tea rose which exactly
matched it.</p>

<p>"I shall carry you home with me when I
go," she told Imogen as she helped her undress.
"You must come down and make us
a good long visit. I can't and won't have
you left alone up here, to keep the house
and sit for hours every day imagining that
Lionel is being gored by wild bulls."</p>

<p>"When you go?" repeated Imogen, in a
dismayed tone; "but yes, of course you
must go&mdash;what was I thinking of?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not while you need me," said Clover,
soothingly. "But you are nearly well now,
and will soon be able to do everything
for yourself."</p>

<p>"I am absolutely silly," said Imogen, with
her eyes full of tears. "What extraordinary
things fevers are! I declare, I am as bad as
any child. It is absurd, but the mere idea of
having to give you up makes me quite cold
and miserable."</p>

<p>"But you won't have to give me up; we
are going to be neighbors still, and see each
other every day. And you won't be ill again,
you know. You are acclimated now, Dr.
Hope says."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I hope so; I am sure I hope so.
And yet, do you know, I almost think I would
go through the fever all over again for the
sake of having you take care of me!"</p>

<p>"Why, my dear child, what a thing to
say! It's the greatest compliment I ever
had in my life, but yet&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It's no compliment at all. I should
never think of paying you compliments. I
couldn't."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is sad for me. Compliments are
nice things, I think."</p>

<p>Imogen suddenly knelt down and put her
arms on Clover's lap as she sat by the
window.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you something," she said
in a broken voice. "I was so unjust when I
came over,&mdash;so rude and unkind in my
thoughts. You will hardly believe it, but I
didn't like you!"</p>

<p>"I can believe it without any particular
difficulty. Everybody can't like me, you
know."</p>

<p>"Everybody ought to. You are simply
the best, dearest, truest person I ever knew.
Oh, I can't half say what you are, but I
know! You have heaped coals of fire on my
head. Perhaps that's the reason my hair has
fallen off so," with a mirthless laugh. "I
used to feel them burn and burn, on those
nights when I lay all scorching up with fever,
and you sat beside me so cool and sweet and
patient. And there is more still. I was jealous
because I fancied that Isabel liked you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
better than she did me. Did you ever suspect
that?"</p>

<p>"Never till you were ill. Some little
things that you muttered when you were not
quite yourself put the idea into my head."</p>

<p>"I can't think why I was so idiotic about
it. Of course she liked you best,&mdash;who
wouldn't? How horrid it was in me to feel
so! I used to try hard not to, but it was of
no use; I kept on all the same."</p>

<p>"But you're not jealous now, I hope?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," shaking her head. "The feeling
seems all burnt out of me. If I am ever
jealous again it will be just the other way,
for fear you will care for her and not at all
for me."</p>

<p>"I do believe you are making me a declaration
of attachment!" cried Clover, amazed
beyond expression at this outburst, but inexpressibly
pleased. The stiff, reserved Imogen
seemed transformed. Her face glowed
with emotion, her words came in a torrent.
She was altogether different from her usual
self.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"Attachment! If I were not attached to
you I should be the most ungrateful wretch
going. Here you have stayed away from home
all these weeks, and worked like a servant
making me all those lovely lemon-squashes
and things, and letting your own affairs go to
wrack and ruin, and you never seemed to remember
that you <i>had</i> any affairs, or that there
was such a thing as getting tired,&mdash;never
seemed to remember anything except to take
care of me. You are an angel&mdash;there is nobody
like you. I don't believe any one else
in the world would have done what you did
for a stranger who had no claim upon you."</p>

<p>"That is absurd," said Clover, frightened
at the probable effect of all this excitement
on her patient, and trying to treat the matter
lightly. "You exaggerate things dreadfully.
We all have a claim on each other, especially
here in the Valley where there are so few of
us. If I had been ill you would have turned
to and helped to nurse me as I did you, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"I shouldn't have known how."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"You would have learned how just as I
did. Emergencies are wonderful teachers.
Now, dear Imogen, you <i>must</i> get to bed. If
you excite yourself like this you will have
a bad night and be put back."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll sleep. I promise you that I will
sleep if only you will let me say just one
more thing. I won't go on any more about
the things you have done, though it's all
true,&mdash;and I don't exaggerate in the least,
for all that you say I do; but never mind
that, only please tell me that you forgive me.
I can't rest till you say that."</p>

<p>"For what,&mdash;for not liking me at first;
for being jealous of Isabel? Both were natural
enough, I think. Isabel was your dearest
friend; and I was a new-comer, an interloper.
I never meant to come between you, I am
sure; but I daresay that I seemed to do so,
and I can understand it all easily. There is
no question of forgiving between us, dear,
only of forgetting. We are friends now, and
we will both love Isabel; and I will love you
if you will let me, and you shall love me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>"How good you are!" exclaimed Imogen,
as Clover bent over for a good-night kiss.
She put her arms round Clover's neck and
held her tight for a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed," she sighed. "I don't deserve
it after my bad behavior, but I shall
be only too glad if I may be your friend.
I don't believe any other girl in the world
has two so good as you and Isabel."</p>

<p>"Don't lie awake to think over our perfections,"
said Clover, as she withdrew with
the candle. "Go to sleep, and remember
that you are coming down to the Hut with
me for a visit, whenever I go."</p>

<p>Dr. Hope, however, negatived this suggestion
decidedly. He was an autocrat with his
sick people, and no one dared dispute his
decisions.</p>

<p>"What your young woman needs is to get
away from the Valley for a while into lower
air; and what you need is to have her go,
and forget that you have been nursing her,"
he told Clover. "There is a look of tension
about you both which is not the correct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
thing. She'll improve much faster at St.
Helen's than here, and besides, I want her
under my eye for a while. Mary shall send
up an invitation to-morrow, and mind that
you make her accept it."</p>

<p>So the next day came the most cordial
of notes from Mrs. Hope, asking Imogen to
spend a fortnight with her.</p>

<p>"Dr. Hope wishes to consider you his patient
a little longer," she wrote, "and says
the lower level will do you good; and I
want you as much as he does for other reasons.
St. Helen's is rather empty just now,
in this betwixt-and-between season, and a
visitor will be a real God-send to me. I am
so afraid that you will be disobliging, and
say 'No,' that I have made the doctor put
it in the form of a prescription; and please
tell Clover that we count upon her to see
that you begin to take the remedy without
delay."</p>

<p>And sure enough, on the doctor's prescription
paper, with the regular appeal to Jupiter
which heads all prescriptions, a formula was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
enclosed setting forth with due professional
precision that Miss Imogen Young was to be
put in a carryall, "well shaken" on the way
down, and taken in fourteen daily doses in
the town of St. Helen's. "Immediate."</p>

<p>"How very good of them!" said Imogen.
"Everybody is so wonderfully good to me!
I think America must be the kindest country
in the world!"</p>

<p>She made no difficulty about accepting the
invitation, and resigned herself to the will
of her friends with a docility that was astonishing
to everybody except Clover, who was
in the secret of her new-born resolves. They
packed her things at once, and Lionel drove
her down to St. Helen's the very day after
the reception of Mrs. Hope's note. Imogen
parted from the sisters with a warm embrace,
but she clung longest to Clover.</p>

<p>"You will let me come for a night or two
when I return, before I settle again at home,
won't you?" she said. "I shall be half-starved
to see you, and a mile is a goodish
bit to get over when you're not strong."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, of course," said Clover, delighted.
"We shall count on it, and Lion has promised
to stay with us all the time you are
away."</p>

<p>"I do think that girl has experienced a
change of heart," remarked Elsie, as they
turned to go in-doors. "She seems really
fond of you, and almost fond of me. It is
no wonder, I am sure, so far as you are
concerned, after all you have done for her.
I never supposed she could look so pretty
or come so near being agreeable as she does
now. Evidently mountain-fever is what the
English emigrant of the higher classes needs
to thaw him out and attune him to American
ways. It's a pity they can't all be
inoculated with it on landing.</p>

<p>"Now, Clovy,&mdash;my dear, sweet old Clovy,&mdash;what
fun it is to have you at home
again!" she went on, giving her sister a
rapturous embrace. "I wouldn't mention it
so long as you had to be away, but I have
missed you horribly. 'There's no luck about
the house' when you are not in it. We have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
all been out of sorts,&mdash;Geoff quite down in
the mouth, little Geoff not at all contented
with me as a mother; even Euphane has
worn a long face and exhibited a tendency
to revert to the Isle of Man, which she never
showed so long as you were to the fore. As
for me, I have felt like a person with one
lung, or half a head,&mdash;all broken up, and
unlike myself. Oh, dear! how good it is to
get you back, and be able to consult you and
look at you! Come upstairs at once, and
unpack your things, and we will play that
you have never been away, and that the
last month is nothing but a disagreeable
dream from which we have waked up."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> delightful to get back," admitted
Clover; "still the month has had its nice
side, too. Imogen is so sweet and grateful
and demonstrative that it would astonish
you. She is like a different girl. I really
think she has grown to love me."</p>

<p>"I should say that nothing was more probable.
But don't let's talk of Imogen now.
I want you all to myself."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>The day had an ending as happy as unexpected.
This was the letter that Lionel
Young brought back that evening from Johnnie
at Burnet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dearest Sisters,</span>&mdash;What do you think has
happened? Something as enchanting as it is
surprising! I wrote you about Dorry's having
the grippe; but I would not tell you what a
serious affair it was, because you were all so
anxious and occupied about Miss Young that I
did not like to add to your worries more than I
could help. He was pretty ill for nearly a week;
and though on the mend now, he is much weakened
and run down, and papa, I can see, considers
him still in a poor way. There is no
chance of his being able to go back to the works
for a couple of months yet, and we were casting
about as to the best way of giving him a change
of air, when, last night, came a note from Mr.
Dayton to say that he has to take a business
run to Salt Lake, with a couple of his directors,
and there are two places in car 47 at our service
if any of us still care to make the trip to
Colorado, late as it is. We had to answer at
once, and we took only ten minutes to make up
our minds. Dorry and I are to start for Chicago<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to-morrow, and will be with you on Thursday if
all goes well,&mdash;and for a good long visit, as the
company have given Dorry a two months' vacation.
We shall come back like common folks at
our own charges, which is an unusual extravagance
for the Carr family; but papa says sickness
is a valid reason for spending money, while
mere pleasure isn't. He thinks the journey will
be the very thing for Dorry. It has all come so
suddenly that I am quite bewildered in my mind.
I don't at all like going away and leaving papa
alone; but he is quite decided about it, and there
is just the bare chance that Katy may run out
for a week or two, so I am going to put my scruples
in my pocket, and take the good the gods
provide, prepared to be very happy. How perfectly
charming it will be to see you all! Somehow
I never pined for you and the valley so much
as I have of late. It was really an awful blow
when the August plan came to nothing, but Fate
is making amends. Thursday! only think of it!
You will just have time to put towels in our
rooms and fill the pitchers before we are there. I
speak for the west corner one in the guest cabin,
which I had last year. Our dear love to you all.</p>

<div class='sig'>
Your affectionate                  <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>.<br />
</div>

<p>P.S. Please tell Mr. Young how happy we are
that his sister is recovering.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is too delicious!" said Elsie, when
she had finished reading this letter. "Dorry,
who never has been here, and John, and for
October, when we so rarely have anybody!
I think it is a sort of 'reward of merit' for
you, Clover, for taking such good care of
Imogen Young."</p>

<p>"It's a most delightful one if it is. I half
wish now that we hadn't asked Lion to stay
while his sister is gone. He's a dear good
fellow, but it would be nicer to have the
others quite to ourselves, don't you think
so?"</p>

<p>"Clover dear," said Elsie, looking very
wise and significant, "did it never occur to
you that there might be a little something
like a sentiment or tenderness between John
and Lionel? Are you sure that she would
be so thoroughly pleased if we sent him off
and kept her to ourselves?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not. I never thought of such
a thing."</p>

<p>"You never <i>do</i> think of such things. I
am much sharper about them than you are,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and I have observed a tendency on the
part of Miss John to send messages to that
young man in her letters, and always in postscripts.
Mark that, <i>postscripts</i>! There is
something very suspicious in postscripts, and
he invariably blushes immensely when I deliver
them."</p>

<p>"You are a great deal too sharp," responded
Clover, laughing. "You see through millstones
that don't exist. It would be very
nice if it were so, but it isn't. I don't believe
a word about your postscripts and
blushes; you've imagined it all."</p>

<p>"Some people are born stupid in these directions,"
retorted Elsie. "I'll bet you Phillida's
back-hair against the first tooth that
Geoffy loses that I am right."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>THE ECHOES IN THE EAST CANYON.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 98px;">
<img src="images/drop_l.png" width="98" height="100" alt="L" title="L" />
</div><div class='unindent'>IONEL certainly did redden when
Johnnie's message was delivered to
him. The quick-eyed Elsie noted
it and darted a look at Clover, but Clover
only shook her head slightly in return. Each
sister adhered to her own opinion.</div>

<p>They were very desirous that the High
Valley should make a favorable impression
on Dorry, for it was his first visit to them.
The others had all been there except Katy, and
she had seen Cheyenne and St. Helen's, but to
Dorry everything west of the Mississippi was
absolutely new. He was a very busy person
in these days, and quite the success of the
Carr family in a moneyed point of view. The
turn for mechanics which he exhibited in
boyhood had continued, and determined his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
career. Electrical science had attracted his
attention in its earlier, half-developed stages;
he had made a careful study of it, and qualified
himself for the important position which
he held under the company, which was fast
revolutionizing the lighting and street-car
system of Burnet, now growing to be a large
manufacturing centre. This was doing well
for a young fellow not quite twenty-five, and
his family were very proud of him. He was too
valuable to his employers to be easily spared,
and except for the enforced leisure of the
grippe it might probably have been years before
he felt free to make his sisters in Colorado
a visit, in which case nothing would have
happened that did happen.</p>

<p>"Dear, steady old Sobersides!" said Elsie,
as she spread a fresh cover over the shelf
which did duty for a bureau in the Bachelors'
Room; "I wonder what he will think of it
all. I'm afraid he will be scandalized at our
scrambling ways, and our having no regular
church, and consider us a set of half-heathen
Bohemians."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't believe it. Dorry has too much good
sense, and has seen too much of the world
among business men to be easily shocked.
And our little Sunday service is very nice, I
think; Geoff reads so reverently,&mdash;and for
sermons, we have our pick of the best there
are."</p>

<p>"I know, and I like them dearly myself;
but I seem to feel that Dorry will miss the
pulpit and sitting in a regular pew. He's
rather that sort of person, don't you think?"</p>

<p>"You are too much inclined to laugh at
Dorry," said Clover, reprovingly, "and he
doesn't deserve it of you. He's a thoroughly
good, sensible fellow, and has excellent
abilities, papa says,&mdash;not brilliant, but
very sound. I don't like to have you speak
so of him."</p>

<p>"Why, Clovy&mdash;my little Clovy, I almost
believe you are scolding me! Let me look
at you,&mdash;yes, there's quite a frown on your
forehead, and your mouth has the firm look
of grandpapa Carr's <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'daguerrotype'">daguerreotype</ins>. I'll be
good,&mdash;really I will. Don't fire again,&mdash;I've<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
'come down' like the coon in the anecdote.
Dorry's a dear, and you are another,
and I'm ever so glad he's coming;
but really, it's not in human nature not to
laugh at the one solemn person in a frivolous
family like ours, now is it?"</p>

<p>"See that you behave yourself, then, and
I'll not scold you any more," replied Clover,
magisterially, and ignoring the last question.
She marred the effect of her lecture by kissing
Elsie as she spoke; but it was hard to
resist the temptation, Elsie was so droll and
coaxing, and so very pretty.</p>

<p>They expected to find Dorry still something
of an invalid, and made preparations accordingly;
but there was no sign of debility in
his jump from the carriage or his run up the
steps to greet them. He was a little thinner
than usual, but otherwise seemed quite himself.</p>

<p>"It's the air," explained Johnnie, "this
blessed Western air! He was forlorn when
we left Burnet, and <i>so</i> tired when we got to
Chicago; but after that he improved with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
every mile, and when we reached Denver
this morning he seemed fresher than when
we started. I do think Colorado air the true
elixir of life."</p>

<p>"It is quite true, what she says. I feel like
a different man already," added Dorry. "Clover,
you look a little pulled down yourself.
Was it nursing Miss What's-her-name?"</p>

<p>"I'm all right. Another day or two will quite
rest me. I came home only day before yesterday,
you see. How delicious it is to have
you both here! Dorry dear, you must have
some beef-tea directly,&mdash;Euphane has a little
basin of it ready,&mdash;and dinner will be in about
an hour."</p>

<p>"Beef-tea! What for? I don't need anything
of the sort, I assure you. Roast mutton,
which I seem to smell in the distance, is
much more in my line. I want to look about
and see your house. What do you call that
snow-peak over there? This is a beautiful
place of yours, I declare."</p>

<p>"Papa would open his eyes if he could see
him," remarked Johnnie, confidentially, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
she got her sisters to herself a little later.
"It's like a miracle the way he has come up.
He was so dragged and miserable and so <i>very</i>
cross only three days ago. Now, you dear
things, let me look at you both. Are you
quite well? How are the brothers-in-law?
Where are the babies, and what have you
done with Miss Young?"</p>

<p>"The brothers-in-law are all right. They
will be back presently. There is a round-up
to-day, which was the reason we sent Isadore
in with the carriage; no one else could be
spared. The babies are having their supper,&mdash;you
will see them anon,&mdash;and Imogen has
gone for a fortnight to St. Helen's."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Johnnie turned aside and began
to take down her hair. "Mr. Young is with
her, I suppose."</p>

<p>"No, indeed, he is here, and staying with
us. You will see him at dinner."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Johnnie again. There was a
difference between these two "ohs," which
Elsie's quick ear detected.</p>

<p>"Please unlock that valise," went on Johnnie,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
"and take out the dress on top. This I have
on is too dreadfully dusty to be endured."</p>

<p>Joanna Carr had grown up very pretty;
many people considered her the handsomest
of the four sisters. Taller than any of them
except Katy, and of quite a different build,
large, vigorous, and finely formed, she had
a very white skin, hair of pale bronze-brown,
and beautiful velvety dark eyes with thick
curling lashes. She had a turn for dress too,
and all colors suited her. The woollen gown
of cream-yellow which she now put on seemed
exactly what was needed to throw up the tints
of her hair and complexion; but she would
look equally well on the morrow in blue.
With quick accustomed fingers she whisked
her pretty locks into a series of artlessly artful
loops, with little blowing rings about the
forehead, and stuck a bow in here and a pin
there, talking all the time, and finally caught
little Phillida up in her strong young arms,
and ran downstairs just in time to greet the
boys as they dismounted at the door, and
shake hands demurely with Lionel Young, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
came with them. All three had raced down
from the very top of the Upper Valley at
breakneck speed, to be in time to welcome
the travellers.</p>

<p>There is always one moment, big with
fate, when processes begin to take place;
when the first fine needle of crystallization
forms in the transparent fluid; when the impulse
of the jellying principle begins to work
on the fruit-juice, and the frost principle to
inform the water atoms. These fateful moments
are not always perceptible to our dull
apprehensions, but none the less do they
exist; and they are apt to take us by surprise,
because we have not detected the fine
gradual chain of preparation which has made
ready for them.</p>

<p>I think one of these fateful moments occurred
that evening, as Lionel Young held
Joanna Carr's hand, and his straight-forward
English eyes poured an ardent beam of welcome
into hers. They had seen a good deal
of each other two years before, but neither
was prepared to be quite so glad to meet<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
again. They did not pause to analyze or
classify their feelings,&mdash;people rarely do when
they really feel; but from that night their
attitude toward each other was changed, and
the change became more apparent with every
day that followed.</p>

<p>As these days went on, bright, golden days,
cloudless, and full of the zest and snap of the
nearing cold, Dorry grew stronger and
stronger. So well did he feel that after the first
week or so he began to allude to himself as
quite recovered, and to show an ominous desire
to get back to his work; but this suggestion
was promptly scouted by everybody, especially
by John, who said she had come for six
weeks at least, and six weeks at least she
should stay,&mdash;and as much longer as she
could; and that Dorry as her escort <i>must</i> stay
too, no matter how well he might feel.</p>

<p>"Besides," she argued, "there's all your
life before you in which to dig away at dynamos
and things, and you may never be in
Colorado again. You wouldn't have the
heart to disappoint Clover and Elsie and hurry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
back, when there's no real necessity. They
are so pleased to have a visit from you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll stay! I'll certainly stay," said
Dorry. "You shall have your visit out, John;
only, when a fellow feels as perfectly well as
I do, it seems ridiculous for him to be sitting
round with his hands folded, taking a mountain
cure which he doesn't need."</p>

<p>Autumn is the busiest season for cattlemen
everywhere, which made it the more singular
that Lionel Young should manage to find so
much time for sitting and riding with Johnnie,
or taking her to walk up the steepest and
loneliest canyons. They were together in
one way or another half the day at least; and
during the other half Johnnie's face wore
always a pre-occupied look, and was dreamily
happy and silent. Even Clover began to
perceive that something unusual was in the
air, something that seemed a great deal too
good to be true. She and Elsie held conferences
in private, during which they hugged
each other, and whispered that "If! whenever!&mdash;if
ever!&mdash; Papa would surely come<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
out and live in the Valley. He never could
resist <i>three</i> of his girls all at once." But they
resolved not to say one word to Johnnie,
or even <i>look</i> as if they suspected anything, lest
it should have a discouraging effect.</p>

<p>"It never does to poke your finger into a
bird's nest," observed Elsie, with a sapient
shake of the head. "The eggs always addle
if you do, or the young birds refuse to hatch
out; and of course in the case of turtle-doves
it would be all the more so. 'Lay low, Bre'r
Fox,' and wait for what happens. It all
promises delightfully, only I don't see exactly,
supposing this ever comes to anything, how
Imogen Young is to be disposed of."</p>

<p>"We won't cross that bridge till we come
to it," said Clover; but all the same she did
cross it in her thoughts many times. It is
not in human nature to keep off these mental
bridges.</p>

<p>At the end of the fortnight Imogen returned
in very good looks and spirits; and further
beautified by a pretty autumn dress of dark
blue, which Mrs. Hope had persuaded her to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
order, and over the making of which she
herself had personally presided. It fitted
well, and set off to admiration the delicate
pink and white of Imogen's skin, while the
new warmth of affection which had come into
her manner was equally becoming.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say what a pretty girl
Miss Young was?" demanded Dorry the very
first evening.</p>

<p>"I don't know, I'm sure. She looks better
than she did before she was ill, and she's
very nice and all that, but we never thought
of her being exactly pretty."</p>

<p>"I can't think why; she is certainly much
better-looking than that Miss Chase who was
here the other day. I should call her decidedly
handsome; and she seems easy to
get on with too."</p>

<p>"Isn't it odd?" remarked Elsie, as she retailed
this conversation to Clover. "Imogen
never seemed to me so very easy to get on
with, and Dorry never before seemed to find
it particularly easy to get on with any girl.
I suppose they happen to suit, but it is very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
queer that they should. People are always
surprising you in that way."</p>

<p>What with John's recently developed tendency
to disappear into canyons with Lionel
Young, with the boys necessarily so occupied,
and their own many little tasks and home
duties, there had been moments during the
fortnight when Clover and Elsie had found
Dorry rather heavy on their hands. He was
not much of a reader except in a professional
way, and still less of a horseman; so the two
principal amusements of the Valley counted
for little with him, and they feared he would
feel dull, or fancy himself neglected. With
the return of Imogen these apprehensions
were laid at rest. Dorry, if left alone,
promptly took the trail in the direction of
the "Hutlet," returning hours afterward looking
beaming and contented, to casually mention
by way of explanation that he had been
reading aloud to Miss Young, or that he and
Miss Young had been taking a walk.</p>

<p>"It's remarkably convenient," Elsie remarked
one evening; "but it's just as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
remarkably queer. What can they find to
say to each other do you suppose?"</p>

<p>If Dorry had not been Dorry, besides being
her brother, she would probably have arrived
at a conclusion about the matter much sooner
than she did. Quick people are too apt to
imagine that slow people have nothing to say,
or do not know how to say it when they
have; while all the time, for slow and quick
alike, there is the old, old story for each to
tell in his own way, which makes the most
halting lips momentarily eloquent, and which
both to speaker and listener seems forever new,
fresh, wonderful, and inexhaustibly interesting.</p>

<p>In a retired place like the High Valley
intimacies flourish with wonderful facility and
quickness. A month in such a place counts
for more than half a year amid the confusions
and interruptions of the city. Dorry had been
struck by Imogen that first evening. He had
never got on very well with girls, or known
much about them; there was a delightful
novelty in his present sensations. There was
not a word as to the need of getting back to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
business after she dawned on his horizon.
Quite the contrary. Two weeks, three, four
went by; the original limit set for the visit
was passed, the end of his holiday drew
near, and still he stayed on contentedly, and
every day devoted himself more and more
to Imogen Young.</p>

<p>She, on her part, was puzzled and fluttered,
but not unhappy. She was quite
alive to Dorry's merits; he was her first
admirer, and it was a new and agreeable
feature of life to have one, "like other
girls," as she told herself. Lionel was too
much absorbed in his own affairs to notice
or interfere; so the time went on, and the
double entanglement wound itself naturally
and happily to its inevitable conclusion.</p>

<p>It was in the beautiful little ravine to
the east, which Clover had named "Penstamen
Canyon," from the quantity of those
flowers which grew there, that Dorry made
his final declaration. There were no penstamens
in the valley now, no yuccas or
columbines, only a few belated autumn crocuses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
and the scarlet berried mats of kinnikinick
remained; but the day was as golden-bright
as though it were still September.</p>

<p>"We have known each other only four
weeks," said Dorry, going straight to the
point in his usual direct fashion; "and if
I were going to stay on I should think I
had no right, perhaps, to speak so soon,&mdash;for
your sake, mind, not for my own; I
could not be surer about my feelings for
you if we had been acquainted for years.
But I have to go away before long, back
to my home and my work, and I really
cannot go without speaking. I must know
if there is any chance for me."</p>

<p>"I like you very much," said Imogen,
demurely.</p>

<p>"Do you? Then perhaps one day you
might get to like me better still. I'd do
all that a man could to make you happy
if you would, and I think you'd like Burnet
to live in. It's a big place, you know,
with all the modern improvements,&mdash;not
like this, which, pretty as it is, would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
rather lonely in the winters, I should think.
There are lots of nice people in Burnet, and
there's Johnnie, whom you already know,
and my father,&mdash;you'd be sure to like my
father."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't go on in this way, as if it were
only for the advantages of the change that
I should consent. It would be for quite different
reasons, if I did." Then, after a short
pause, she added, "I wonder what they will
say at Bideford."</p>

<p>It was an indirect yes, but Dorry understood
that it <i>was</i> yes.</p>

<p>"Then you'll think of it? You don't
refuse me? Imogen, you make me very
happy."</p>

<p>Dorry did look happy; and as bliss is
beautifying, he looked handsome as well.
His strong, well-knit figure showed to advantage
in the rough climbing-suit which
he wore; his eyes sparkled and beamed as
he looked at Imogen.</p>

<p>"May I talk with Lionel about it?" he
asked, persuasively. "He represents your
father over here, you know."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so." She blushed a little,
but looked frankly up at Dorry. "Poor
Lion! it's hard lines for him, and I feel
guilty at the idea of deserting him so soon;
but I know your sisters will be good to
him, and I can't help being glad that you
care for me. Only there's one thing I must
say to you, Theodore [no one since he was
baptized had ever called Dorry 'Theodore'
till now!], for I don't want you to fancy me
nicer than I really am. I was horribly stiff
and prejudiced when I first came out. I
thought everything American was inferior
and mistaken, and all the English ways were
best; and I was nasty,&mdash;yes, really very
nasty to your sisters, especially dear Clover.
I have learned her worth now, and I love
her and America, and I shall love it all the
better for your sake; but all the same, I
shall probably disappoint you sometimes, and
be stiff and impracticable and provoking,
and you will need to have patience with me:
it's the price you must pay if you marry an
English wife,&mdash;this particular English wife,
at least."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's a price that I'll gladly pay," cried
Dorry, holding her hand tight. "Not that
I believe a word you say; but you are the
dearest, truest, honestest girl in the world,
and I love you all the better for being so
modest about yourself. For me, I'm just a
plain, sober sort of fellow. I never was
bright like the others, and there's nothing
in the least 'subtle' or hard to understand
about me; but I don't believe I shall make
the worse husband for that. It's only in
French novels that dark, inscrutable characters
are good for daily use."</p>

<p>"Indeed, I don't want an inscrutable husband.
I like you much better as you are."
Then, after a happy pause, "Isabel Templestowe&mdash;she's
Geoff's sister, you know,
and my most intimate friend at home&mdash;predicted
that I should marry over here, but
I never supposed I should. It didn't seem
likely that any one would want me, for I'm
not pretty or interesting, like your sisters,
you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say!" cried Dorry, "haven't I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
been telling you that you interest me more
than any one in the world ever did before?
I never saw a girl whom I considered could
hold a candle to you,&mdash;certainly not one
of my own sisters. You don't think your
people at home will make any objections,
do you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed; they'll be very pleased to
have me settled, I should think. There are
a good many of us at home, you know."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a little farther up the same
canyon, but screened from observation by a
projecting shoulder of rock, another equally
satisfactory conversation was going on between
another pair of lovers. Johnnie and
Lionel had strolled up there about an hour
before Dorry and Imogen arrived. They had
no idea that any one else was in the ravine.</p>

<p>"I think I knew two years ago that I
cared more for you than any one else,"
Lionel was saying.</p>

<p>"Did you? Perhaps the faintest suspicion
of such a thing occurred to me too."</p>

<p>"I used to keep thinking about you at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
odd minutes all day, when I was working
over the cattle and everything, and I always
thought steadily about you at night when
I was falling asleep."</p>

<p>"Very strange, certainly."</p>

<p>"And the moment you came and I saw
you again, it flashed upon me what it meant;
and I perceived that I had been desperately
in love with you all along without knowing
it."</p>

<p>"Still stranger."</p>

<p>"Don't tease me, darling Johnnie,&mdash;no,
Joan; I like that better than Johnnie. It
makes me think of Joan d'Arc. I shall call
you that, may I?"</p>

<p>"How can I help it? You have a big
will of your own, as I always knew. Only
don't connect me with the ark unless you
spell it, and don't call me Jonah."</p>

<p>"Never! He was the prophet of evil,
and you are the good genius of my life."</p>

<p>"I'm not sure whether I am or not. It
plunges you into all sorts of embarrassments
to think of marrying me. Neither of us<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
has any money. You'll have to work hard
for years before you can afford a wife,&mdash;and
then there's your sister to be considered."</p>

<p>"I know. Poor Moggy! But she came
out for my sake. She will probably be
only too glad to get home again whenever&mdash;other
arrangements are possible. Will
you wait a while for me, my sweet?"</p>

<p>"I don't mind if I do."</p>

<p>"How long will you wait?"</p>

<p>"Shall we say ten years?"</p>

<p>"Ten years! By Jove, no! We'll say
no such thing! But eighteen months,&mdash;we'll
fix it at eighteen months, or two
years at farthest. I can surely fetch it in
two years."</p>

<p>"Very well, then; I'll wait two years
with pleasure."</p>

<p>"I don't ask you to wait <i>with pleasure</i>!
That's carrying it a little too far!"</p>

<p>"I don't seem able to please you, whatever
I say," remarked Johnnie, pretending
to pout.</p>

<p>"Please me, darling Joan! You please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
me down to the ground, and you always
did! But if you'll wait two years,&mdash;not
with pleasure, but with patience and resignation,&mdash;I'll
buckle to with a will and
earn my happiness. Your father won't be
averse, will he?"</p>

<p>"Poor papa! Yes, he <i>is</i> very averse to
having his girls marry, but he's somewhat
hardened to it. I'm the last of the four,
you know, and I think he would give his
blessing to you rather than any one else,
because you would bring me out here to
live near the others. Perhaps he will come
too. It is the dream of Clover's and Elsie's
lives that he should."</p>

<p>"That would be quite perfect for us all."</p>

<p>"You say that to please me, I know, but
you will say it with all your heart if ever it
happens, for my father is the sweetest man
in the world, and the wisest and most reasonable.
You will love him dearly. He
has been father and mother and all to us
children. And there's my sister Katy,&mdash;you
will love her too."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>"I have seen her once, you remember."</p>

<p>"Yes; but you can't find Katy out at
once,&mdash;there is too much of her. Oh, I've
ever so many nice relations to give you.
There's Ned Worthington; he's a dear,&mdash;and
Cousin Helen. Did I ever tell you
about her? She's a terrible invalid, you
know, almost always confined to her bed
or sofa, and yet she has been one of the great
influences of our lives,&mdash;a sort of guardian
angel, always helping and brightening and
cheering us all, and starting us in right directions.
Oh, you must know her. I can't think
how you ever will, for of course she can
never come to Colorado; but somehow it
shall be managed. Now tell me about <i>your</i>
people. How many are there of you?"</p>

<p>"Eleven, and I scarcely remember my oldest
brother, he went away from home so long
ago. Jim was my chum,&mdash;he's no end of
a good fellow. He's in New Zealand now.
And Beatrice&mdash;that's the next girl to Imogen&mdash;is
awfully nice too, and there are one
or two jolly ones among the smaller kids. Oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
you'll like them all, especially my mother.
We'll go over some day and make them a
visit."</p>

<p>"That will be nice; but we shall have to
wait till we grow rich before we can take
such a long journey. Lion, do you think
by-and-by we could manage to build another
house, or move your cabin farther
down the Valley? I want to live nearer
Clover and Elsie. You'll have to be away
a good deal, of course, as the other boys are,
and a mile is 'a goodish bit,' as Imogen
would say. It would make all the difference
in the world if I had the sisters close at hand
to 'put my lips to when so dispoged.'"</p>

<p>"Why, of course we will. Geoff built the
Hutlet, you know; I didn't put any money
into it. I chose the position because&mdash;well,
the view was good, and I didn't know how
Moggy would hit it off with the rest, you understand.
I thought she might do better a
little farther away; but with you it's quite different
of course. I dare say the Hutlet could
be moved; I'll talk to Geoff about it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't care how simple it is, so long as
it is near the others," went on Johnnie. "It's
easy enough to make a simple house pretty
and nice. I am so glad that your house is
in this valley, Lion."</p>

<p>A little pause ensued.</p>

<p>"What was that?" asked Johnnie, suddenly.</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"That sound? It seemed to come from
down the canyon. Such a very odd echo, if
it was an echo!"</p>

<p>"What kind of a sound? I heard nothing."</p>

<p>"Voices, I should say, if it were not quite
impossible that it could be voices,&mdash;very low
and hushed, as if a ghost were confabulating
with another ghost about a quarter of a mile
away."</p>

<p>"Oh, that must be just a fancy," protested
Lionel. "There isn't a living soul within a
mile of us."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/illus04.png" width="325" height="450" alt="&quot;Voices, I should say, if it were not quite impossible that it could be voices,&mdash;very low and hushed.&quot;&mdash;Page 260." title="" />
<span class="caption">&quot;Voices, I should say, if it were not quite impossible that it could be voices,&mdash;very low and hushed.&quot;&mdash;Page 260.</span>
</div>

<p>And at the same moment Dorry, a couple
of hundred feet distant, was remarking to
Imogen:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"These canyons do have the most extraordinary
echoes. There's the strangest cooing
and sibilating going on above."</p>

<p>"Wood pigeons, most probably; there are
heaps of them hereabout."</p>

<p>Presently the pair from above, slowly climbing
down the ravine hand-in-hand, came upon
the pair below, just rising from their seat to
go home. There was a mutual consternation
in the four countenances comical to behold.</p>

<p>"You here!" cried Imogen.</p>

<p>"And <i>you</i> here!" retorted Lionel. "Why,
we never suspected it. What brought you
up?&mdash;and Carr, too, I declare!"</p>

<p>"Why&mdash;oh&mdash;it's a pretty place," stammered
Imogen. "Theodore&mdash;Mr. Carr, I
mean&mdash; Now, Lionel, what <i>are</i> you laughing
at?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said her brother, composing his
features as best he could; "only it's such a
very odd coincidence, you know."</p>

<p>"Very odd indeed," remarked Dorry,
gravely. The four looked at one another
solemnly and questioningly, and then&mdash;it was
impossible to help it&mdash;all four laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"By Jove!" cried Lionel, between his paroxysms,
"I do believe we have all come up
here on the same errand!"</p>

<p>"I dare say we have," remarked Dorry;
"there were some extremely queer echoes
that came down to us from above."</p>

<p>"Not a bit queerer, I assure you, than some
which floated up to us from below," retorted
Johnnie, recovering her powers of speech.</p>

<p>"We thought it was doves."</p>

<p>"And we were sure it was ghosts,&mdash;affectionate
ghosts, you know, on excellent terms
with each other."</p>

<p>"Young, I want a word with you," said
Dorry, drawing Lionel aside.</p>

<p>"And I want a word with you."</p>

<p>"And I want several words with you," cried
Johnnie, brightly, putting her arm through
Imogen's. She looked searchingly at her.</p>

<p>"I'm going to be your sister," she said;
"I've promised Lionel. Are you going to
be mine?"</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;I've promised Theodore&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Theodore!" cried Johnnie, with a world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
of admiration in her voice. "Oh, you mean
Dorry. We never call him that, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but I prefer Theodore.
Dorry seems a childish sort of name for a
grown man. Do you mean to say that you
are coming out to the Valley to live?"</p>

<p>"Yes, by-and-by, and you will come to
Burnet; we shall just change places. Isn't it
nice and queer?"</p>

<p>"It is a sort of double-barrelled International
Alliance," declared Lionel. "Now let
us go down and astonish the others."</p>

<p>The others <i>were</i> astonished indeed. They
were prepared for Johnnie's confession, but
had so little thought of Dorry's that for some
time he and Imogen stood by unheeded, waiting
their turn at explanation.</p>

<p>"Why, Dorry," cried Elsie at last, "why
are you standing on one side like that with
Miss Young? You don't look as surprised as
you ought. Did you hear the news before
we did? Imogen dear,&mdash;it isn't such good
news for you as for us."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, indeed it is. I am quite as happy
in it as you can be."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ladies and gentlemen," cried Lionel, who
was in topping spirits and could not be restrained,
"this shrinking pair also have a
tale to tell. It is a case of 'change partners
all round and down the middle.' Let me
introduce to you Mr. and Mrs. Theo&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Lion, you wretched boy, stop!" interrupted
Johnnie. "That's not at all the
right way to do it. Let <i>me</i> introduce them.
Friends and countrymen, allow the echoes
of the Upper East Canyon to present to
your favorable consideration the echoes of
the Lower East Canyon. We've all been
sitting up there, 'unbeknownst,' within a
few feet of each other, and none of us could
account for the mysterious noises that we
heard, till we all started to come home, and
met each other on the way down."</p>

<p>"What kind of noises?" demanded Elsie,
in a suffocated voice.</p>

<p>"Oh, cooings and gurglings and soft murmurs
of conversation and whisperings. It
was very unaccountable indeed, very!"</p>

<p>"Dorry," said Elsie, next day when she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
chanced to be alone with him, "Would you
mind if I asked you rather an impertinent
question? You needn't answer if you don't
want to; but what was it that first put it
into your head to fall in love with Imogen
Young? I'm very glad that you did, you
understand. She will make you a capital
wife, and I'm going to be very fond of her,&mdash;but
still, I should just like to know."</p>

<p>"I don't know that I could tell you if I
tried," replied her brother. "How can a
man explain that sort of thing? I fell in
love because I was destined to fall in love, I
suppose. I liked her at the start, and thought
her pretty, and all that; and she seemed kind
of lonely and left out among you all. And
then she's a quiet sort of girl, you know, not
so ready at talk as most, or so quick to pick
at a fellow or trip him up. I've always been
the slow one in our family, you see, and by
way of a change it's rather refreshing to be
with a woman who isn't so much brighter
than I am. The rest of you jump at an idea
and off it again while I'm gathering my wits<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
together to see that there <i>is</i> an idea. Imogen
doesn't do that, and it rather suits me that
she shouldn't. You're all delightful, and
I'm very fond of you, I'm sure; but for
a wife I think I like some one more like
myself."</p>

<p>"Of all the droll explanations that I ever
heard, that is quite the drollest," said Elsie
to her husband afterward. "The idea of a
man's falling in love with a woman because
she's duller than his own sisters! Nobody
but Dorry would ever have thought of it."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<h3>A DOUBLE KNOT.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 100px;">
<img src="images/drop_t.png" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title="T" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE next few days in the High Valley
were too full of excitement and discussions
to be quite comfortable for
anybody. Imogen was seized with compunctions
at leaving Lionel without a housekeeper,
and proposed to Dorry that their wedding
should be deferred till the others were ready
to be married also,&mdash;a suggestion to which
Dorry would not listen for a moment. There
were long business-talks between the ranch
partners as to hows and whens, letters to be
written, and innumerable confabulations between
the three sisters, in which Imogen took
part, for she counted as a fourth sister now.
Clover and Elsie listened and planned and
advised, and found their chief difficulty to
consist in hiding and keeping in the background<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
their unfeigned and flattering joy
over the whole arrangement. It made matters
so delightfully easy all round to have
Imogen engaged to Dorry, and it was so
much to their own individual advantage to
exchange her for Johnnie that they really
dared not express their delight too openly.</div>

<p>The great question with all was how papa
would take the announcement, and whether
he could be induced to carry out his half
promise of leaving Burnet and coming to live
with them in the Valley. They waited anxiously
for his reply to the letters. It came
by telegraph two days before they had dared
to hope for it, and was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>God bless you all four! Genesis xliii. 14.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">P. Carr.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>This Biblical addition nearly broke John's
heart. Her sisters had to comfort her
with all manner of hopeful auguries and
promises.</p>

<p>"He'll be glad enough over it in time,"
they told her. "Think what it would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
been if you had been going to marry a Californian,
or a man with an orange plantation
in Florida. He'll see that it's all for the best
as soon as he gets out here, and he <i>must</i>
come. Johnnie, you must never let him off.
Don't take 'no' for an answer. It is so important
to us all that he should consent."</p>

<p>They primed her with persuasive messages
and arguments, and both Clover and Elsie
wrote him a long letter on the subject. On
the very eve of the departure came a second
telegram. Telegrams were not every-day
things in the High Valley, the nearest "wire"
being at the Ute Hotel five miles away; and
the arrival of the messenger on horseback
created a momentary panic.</p>

<p>This telegram was also from Dr. Carr. It
was addressed to Johnnie,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Following just received: "Miss Inches died to-day
of pneumonia." No particulars.</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span class="smcap">P. Carr.</span><br />
</div></div>

<p>It was a great shock to poor Johnnie. She
and "Mamma Marian," as she still called her
god-mother, had been warm friends always;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
they corresponded regularly; Johnnie had
made her several long visits at Inches Mills,
and she had written to her among the first
with the news of her engagement.</p>

<p>"She never got it. She never will know
about Lionel," she kept repeating mournfully.
"And now I can never tell her about any of
my plans, and she would have been so pleased
and interested. She always cared so much
for what I cared about, and I hoped she would
come out here for a long visit some day, and
see you all. Oh dear, oh dear! what a sad
ending to our happy time!"</p>

<p>"Not an ending, only an interruption," put
in the comforting Clover. But John for a
time could not be consoled, and the party
broke up under a cloud, literal as well as
metaphorical, for the first snow-storm was
drifting over the plain as they drove down
the pass, the melting flakes instantly drunk
up by the sand; all the soft blue of distance
had vanished, and a gray mist wrapped
the mountain tops. The High Valley was in
temporary eclipse, its brightness and sparkle
put by for the moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span></p>

<p>But nothing could long eclipse the sunshine
of such youthful hearts and hopes. Before
long John's letters grew cheerful again, and
presently she wrote to announce a wonderful
piece of news.</p>

<p>"Something very strange has happened,"
she began. "I am an heiress! It is just like
the girls in books! Yesterday came a letter
from a firm of lawyers in Boston with a long
document enclosed. It was an extract from
Mamma Marian's will; and only think,&mdash;she
has left me a legacy of thirty thousand dollars!
Dear thing! and she never knew about
my engagement either, or how wonderfully
it was going to help in our plans. She just
did it because she loved me. 'To Joanna
Inches Carr, my namesake and child by affection,'
the will says; and I think it pleases me
as much as having the money. That frightens
me a little, it seems so much. At first I
did not like to take it, and felt as if I might
be robbing some one else; but papa says that
she had no very near relations, and that I need
not hesitate. Oh, my darling Clover, is it not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
wonderful? Now Lion and I need not wait
two years, unless <i>he</i> prefers it, and can just
go on and make our plans happily to suit
ourselves and all of you,&mdash;and I shall love
to think that we owe it all to dear Mamma
Marian; only it will be a sore spot always
that she never got the letter telling of our
engagement. It came just after she died, and
they returned it to me.</p>

<p>"Ned has his orders at last. He goes to
sea in April, and Katy writes to papa that she
will come and spend a year with him if he
likes, while Ned is away. But papa won't
be here. He has quite decided, I think, to
leave Burnet and make his home for the future
with us in the High Valley. Three different
physicians have already offered to buy
out his practice, and it is arranged that Dorry
shall rent the old house of him, and the furniture
too, except the books and a few special
things which papa wishes to keep. He is
going to write to you about the building of
what he is pleased to call 'a separate shanty;'
but please don't let the shanty be really separate;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
he must be in with all of us somehow,
or we shall never be satisfied. Did Lionel
decide to move the Hutlet? Of course Katy
will spend her year in the Valley instead of
Burnet. I am beginning to get my little
trousseau together, and have set up a 'wedding
bureau' to put the things in; but it is
no fun at all without any sisters at home to
help and sympathize. I am the only one who
has had to get ready to be married all by
herself. If Katy were not coming in two
months I should be quite desperate. The
chief thing on my mind is how to arrange
about the two weddings with the family so
scattered as it is."</p>

<p>This difficulty was settled by Clover a little
later. Both the weddings she proposed should
take place in the Valley.</p>

<p>"It is a case of Mahomet and mountain,"
she wrote. "Look at it dispassionately. You
and papa and Katy and Dorry have got to
come out here any way,&mdash;the rest of us <i>are</i>
here; and it is clearly impossible that all of us
should go on to Burnet to see you married,&mdash;though<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
if you persist some of us will, inconvenient
and expensive as it would be.
But just consider what a picturesque and romantic
place the Valley is for a wedding, with
the added advantage that you would be absolutely
the first people who were ever married
in it since the creation of the world! I won't
say what may happen in the remote future,
for Rose Red writes that she is going to
change its name and call it henceforward
'The Ararat Valley,' not only because it
contains 'a few souls, that is eight,' but also
because all the creatures who go into it seem
to enter pell-mell and come out two by two
in pairs. You will inaugurate the long procession
at all events! Do please think seriously
of this, dear John. 'Consider, cow,
consider,&mdash;' and write me that you consent.</p>

<p>"We are building papa the most charming
little bungalow ever seen,&mdash;a big library and
two bedrooms, one for himself and one to
spare. It is just off the southwest corner,
and a little covered way connects it with our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
piazza; for we are quite decided that he is to
take his meals with us and not have the bother
of independent housekeeping. Then if you
decide to put <i>your</i> bungalow on the other
side of his, as we hope you will, we shall all
be close together. Lion will do nothing about
the building till you come. You are to stay
on indefinitely with us, and oversee the
whole thing yourself from the driving of
the first nail. We will all help, and won't
it be fun?</p>

<p>"There is something very stately and comforting
in the idea of a 'resident physician.'
Elsie declares that now Phillida may have
croup or any other infant disease she likes,
and I sha'n't lie awake at night to wonder
what we should do in case Geoffey was
thrown from the burro and broke a bone. I
am not sure but we may yet attain to the dignity
of a 'resident pastor' as well, for Geoff
has decided not to move the Hutlet, but leave
it as it is, putting in a little simple furniture,
and offer it from time to time to some invalid
clergyman who needs Colorado air and would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
be glad to spend a few months in the Valley.
Who knows but it may grow some day into
a little church? Then indeed we should have
a small world of our own, with the learned
professions all represented; for of course Phil
by that time will be qualified to do our law
for us, in case we quarrel and require writs
and replevins or habeas corpuses, or any last
wills and testaments drawn up.</p>

<p>"I have begun on new curtains for Katy's
room already, and Elsie and I have all manner
of beautiful projects for the weddings.
Now Johnnie darling, write at once and say
that you agree to this plan. It really does
seem a perfect one for everybody. The time
must of course depend on when Dorry can
get his leave, but we will be all ready whenever
it comes."</p>

<p>Clover's arguments were unanswerable, and
every one gradually gave in to the plan which
she had so much at heart. Dorry got a
fortnight's holiday, beginning on the 15th of
June; so the twentieth was fixed as the day
for the double wedding, and the preparations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
went merrily on. Early in May Katy arrived
in Burnet; and after that Johnnie had
no need to complain of being unsistered, for
Katy was a host in herself, and gave all her
time to helping everybody. She sewed and
finished, she packed and advised, she assisted
to box her father's books, and went with
Dorry to choose the new papers and rugs
which were to make the old house freshly
bright for Imogen; she exclaimed and rejoiced
over each wedding present that arrived, and
supplied that sweet atmosphere of mutual
interest and sympathy which is the vital
breath of a family occasion. All was ready
in time; the old home was in exact and perfect
order for its new mistress, the good-bys
were said, and on the morning of the fifteenth
the party started for Colorado.</p>

<p>Quite a little group waited for them on
the platform of the St. Helen's station three
days later. Lionel had of course come in to
meet his bride, and Imogen her bridegroom;
and Geoff had come, and Clover, to meet her
father and Katy, and Phil was also in waiting.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
It was truly a wonderful moment when the
train drew up, and Johnnie, all beautiful in
smiles and dimples, encountered Lionel; while
Dorry jumped out to greet Imogen, who was
in blooming health again, and very pleased
to see him.</p>

<p>"We have brought the two carryalls,"
Clover explained. "Geoff got a new one
the other day, that the means of transportation
may keep pace with the increase of
population, as he says. I think, Geoff, we
will put the brides and bridegrooms together
in the new one. Then the 'echoes' from
the back seat can mix with the 'echoes'
from the front seat; and it will be as good
as the East Canyon, and they will all feel
at home."</p>

<p>So it was arranged, and the party started.</p>

<p>"Katy," cried Clover, looking at her sister
with eyes that seemed to drink her in,
"I had forgotten quite how dear you are!
It seems to me that you have grown handsome,
my child; or is it only that you are
a little fatter?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid the latter," replied Katy,
with a laugh. "No one but Ned was ever
so deluded as to call me handsome."</p>

<p>"Where is Ned? It is such a <i>shame</i> that
he can't be here,&mdash;the only one of the
family missing!"</p>

<p>"He is on his way to China," said Katy,
with a little suppressed sigh. "Yes, it is
too bad; but it can't be helped. Naval orders
are like time and tide, and wait for
no man, and most of all for no woman."
She paused a moment, and changed the subject
abruptly. "Did I tell you," she asked,
"that after I broke up at Newport I went
to Rose for a week?"</p>

<p>"Johnnie wrote that you were to go."</p>

<p>"It was such a bright week! Boston
was beautiful, as it always is in spring,
with the Public Garden a blaze of flowers,
and all the pretty country about so
green and sweet! Rose was most delightful;
and I saw ever so many of the old
Hillsover girls, and even had a glimpse of
Mrs. Nipson!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>"That must have been rather a bad joy."</p>

<p>"N&mdash;o, not exactly. I was rather glad,
on the whole, to meet her again. She isn't
as bad as we made her out. School-girls
are almost always unjust to their teachers."</p>

<p>"Oh, come, now," said Clover, making a
little face. "This is a happy occasion, certainly,
and I am in a benignant frame of
mind, but really I can't stand having you
so horridly charitable. 'There is no virtue,
madam, in a mush of concession.' Mrs.
Nipson was an unpleasant old thing,&mdash;so
there! Let us talk of something else. Tell
me about your visit to Cousin Helen."</p>

<p>"Oh, that was a sweet visit all through.
I stayed ten days, and she was better than
usual, it seemed to me. Did I write about
little Helen's ball?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"She is just nineteen, and it was her
first dance. Such a pretty creature, and
so pleased and excited about it! and Cousin
Helen was equally so. She gave Helen her
dress complete, down to the satin shoes,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
and the fan and the long gloves, and a turquoise
necklace, and turquoise pins for her
hair. You never saw anything so charming
as the way in which she enjoyed it.
You would have supposed that Helen was
her own child, as she lay on the sofa, with
such bright beaming eyes, while the pretty
thing turned round and round to exhibit
her finery."</p>

<p>"There certainly never was any one like
Cousin Helen. She is embodied sympathy,"
said Clover. "Now, Katy, I want you to
look. We are just turning into our own
road."</p>

<p>It was a radiant afternoon, with long,
soft shadows alternating with golden sunshine,
and the High Valley was at its very
best as they slowly climbed the zigzag pass.
With every turn and winding Katy's pleasure
grew; and when they rounded the last
curve, and came in sight of the little group
of buildings, with their picturesque background
of forest and the splendid peak soaring
above, she exclaimed with delight:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"What a perfect situation! Clover, you
never said enough about it! Surely the
half was not told me, as the Queen of Sheba
remarked! Oh, and there is Elsie on the
porch, and that thing in white beside her
is Phillida! I never dreamed she could be
so large! How glad I am that I didn't
die of measles when I was little, as dear
Rose Red used to say."</p>

<p>Katy's coming was the crowning pleasure
of the occasion to all, but most of all to
Clover. To have her most intimate sister
in her own home, and be able to see her
every day and all day long, and consult and
advise and lay before her the hopes and
intentions and desires of her heart, which
she could never so fully share with any
one else, except Geoff, was a delight which
never lost its zest, and of which Clover
never grew weary.</p>

<p>To settle Dr. Carr in his new quarters
was another pleasure, in which they all took
equal part. When his books and microscopes
were unpacked, and the Burnet belongings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
arranged pretty much in their old order, the
rooms looked wonderfully homelike, even
to him. The children soon learned to adore
him, as children always had done; the only
trouble was that they fought for the possession
of his knee, and would never willingly
have left him a moment for himself.
His leisure had to be protected by a series
of nursery laws and penances, or he would
never have had any; but he said he liked
the children better than the leisure. He
was born to be a grandfather; nobody told
stories like him, or knew so well how to
please and pacify and hit the taste of little
people.</p>

<p>But all this, of course, came subsequently
to the double wedding, which took place
two days after the arrival of the home-party.
The morning of the twentieth was
unusually fine, even for Colorado,&mdash;fair,
cloudless, and golden bright, as if ordered
for the occasion,&mdash;without a cloud on the
sky from dawn to sunset. The ceremony
was performed by a clergyman from Portland,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
who with his invalid wife were settled
in the Hutlet for the summer, very
glad of the pleasant little home offered
them, and to escape from the crowd and
confusion of Mrs. Marsh's boarding-house,
where Geoff had found them. Two or
three particular friends drove out from St.
Helen's; but with that exception the whole
wedding was "valley-made," as Elsie declared,
including delicious raspberry ice-cream,
and an enormous cake, over which
she and Clover had expended much time
and thought, and which, decorated with emblematical
designs in icing and wreathed
with yucca-blossoms, stood in the middle
of the table.</p>

<p>The ceremony took place at noon precisely,
when, as Phil facetiously observed,
"the shadows of the high contracting parties
could never be less." There was little that
was formal about it, but much that was reverent
and sweet and full of true feeling.
Imogen and Johnnie had both agreed to
wear white muslin dresses, very much such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
dresses as they were all accustomed to wear
on afternoons; but Imogen had on her head
her mother's wedding-veil, which had been
sent out from England, and John wore
Katy's, "for luck," as she said. Both carried
a big bouquet of Mariposa lilies, and
the house was filled with the characteristic
wild-flowers of the region most skilfully and
effectively grouped and arranged.</p>

<p>A hospitably hearty luncheon followed
the ceremony, of which all partook; then
Imogen went away to put on her pretty
travelling-suit of pale brown, and the carry-all
came round to take Mr. and Mrs. Theodore
Carr to St. Helen's, which was the first
stage on their journey of life.</p>

<p>The whole party stood on the porch to
see them go. Imogen's last word and embrace
were for Clover.</p>

<p>"We are sisters now," she whispered. "I
belong to you just as much as Isabel does,
and I am so glad that I do! Dear Clover,
you have been more good to me than I can
say, and I shall never forget it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nonsense about being good! You are
my Dorry's wife now, and our own dear
sister. There is no question about goodness,&mdash;only
to love one another."</p>

<p>She kissed Imogen warmly, and helped
her into the carriage. Dorry sprang after
her; the wheels revolved; and Phil, seizing
a horseshoe which hung ready to hand on
the wall of the house, flung it after the
departing vehicle.</p>

<p>"It's more appropriate than any other
sort of old shoe for this Place of Hoofs,"
he observed. "Well, the Carr family are
certainly pretty well disposed of now. I am
'the last ungathered rose on my ancestral
tree.' I wonder who will tear me from my
stem!"</p>

<p>"You can afford to hang on a while
longer," remarked Elsie. "I don't consider
you fairly expanded yet, by any means.
You'll be twice as well worth gathering a
few years from now."</p>

<p>"Oh, very fine!&mdash;years indeed! Why, I
shall be a seedy old bachelor! That would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
never do! And Amy Ashe, whom I have
had in my eye ever since she was in pinafores,
will be married to some other fellow!"</p>

<p>"Don't set your heart on Amy," said
Katy. "She's not seventeen yet; and I
don't think her mother has any idea of
having her made into <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'Ashe-s'">Ashes</ins> of Roses so
early!"</p>

<p>"There's no harm in having a girl in
one's eye," retorted Phil, disconsolately. "I
declare, you all look so contented and so
satisfied with yourselves and one another,
that it's enough to madden a fellow, left
out, as I am, in the cold! I shall go back
to St. Helen's with Dr. and Mrs. Hope."</p>

<p>The others, left to themselves in their
happy loneliness, gathered together in the
big room after the last guest had gone.
Geoff touched a match to the ready-laid
fire; Clover wheeled an armchair forward
for her father, and sat down beside him
with her arm on his knee; John and
Lionel took possession of a big sofa.</p>

<p>"Now let us enjoy ourselves," said Clover.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
"The world is shut out, we are shut in;
there are none to molest and make us afraid;
and, please Heaven, there is a whole, long,
happy year before us! I never did suppose
anything so perfectly perfect could happen
to us all as this. Now, papa,&mdash;dear papa,&mdash;just
say that you like it as much as we
all do."</p>

<p>Elsie perched herself on the arm of her
father's chair; Katy stood behind, stroking
his hair. Dr. Carr held out his hand to
Johnnie, who ran across the room, knelt
down, caught it in both hers, and fondly
laid her cheek upon it.</p>

<p>"I like it <i>quite</i> as much as you do," he
said. "Where my girls are is the place for
me; and I am going to be the most contented
old gentleman in America for the
rest of my days."</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"What a beautiful book! How fine are the illustrations! How pure and sweet are
these rhymes!" Grandpa bought the book, and Dot was delighted with her present.
So is mamma. She says the stories are as good as she could make them herself. If
you want just the daintiest book of the season, get this. Don't be put off with something
common. This beats "Mother Goose" and all the old nursery books all to
pieces. It contains a great deal of sense, just a little nonsense, and sparkles with fun,
which all the household will relish. This is better than forty dolls, because the dolls
usually can't talk, but this can.&mdash;<i>Illustrated Christian Weekly.</i></p>

<p>This is a charming collection of nursery ballads, full of lively nonsense and quaint
conceits, such as appeal to childish imaginations. The merry rhymes and grotesque
illustrations make each other doubly effective. No better book since "Mother
Goose" than this for reading to children, who will cry, "Again, again," and will
never tire of its felicitous jingles. It is dedicated to "My mother, Julia Ward
Howe."&mdash;<i>Boston Woman's Journal.</i></p>

<p>The rhymes and jingles in this little volume are very genuine products, for they
have every sign of being what many nursery rhymes are not, songs which have stood
the critical test of a house full of children of different ages and varying temperaments
and been approved. Mrs. Richards has a natural gift of striking the whimsical without
rising above the comprehension of young people, nor on the other hand, falling
into the strained or the commonplace.&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>It is like getting a new and greatly enlarged sequel to dear old "Mother Goose"
to take up Mrs. Laura E. Richards's pretty book. She knows how to be funny
without being silly; her rhymes are lively and jingle merrily on the ear; the odd
fancies and quaint imagery are just of the sort to entertain very young children.
"In My Nursery" may be heartily commended as an almost inexhaustible store
house of amusement for little girls and boys.&mdash;<i>The Boston Beacon.</i></p></div>

swallowed up, probably, in some yawning crevice of the
envious earth. The story is written with that simplicity which is
the perfection of art, and its subtle pathos is given full and eloquent
expression. But noble as the book is, viewed as a literary
performance, it owes not a little of its peculiar attractiveness to
the illustrations with which it is now adorned after drawings by

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The child is father of the man."&mdash;so Wordsworth sang; and here is a jolly
story of a little girl who was her father's mother in a very real way. There were
hard lines for him, and she was fruitful of devices to help him along, even having
an auction of the pretty things that had been given her from time to time, and
realizing a neat little sum. Then her father was accused of peculation; and she,
sweetly ignorant of the ways of justice, went to the judge and labored with him,
to no effect, though he was wondrous kind. Then in court she gave just the
wrong evidence, because it showed how poor her father was, and so established a
presumption of his great necessity and desperation. But the <i>Deus ex machina</i>&mdash;the
wicked partner&mdash;arrived at the right moment, and owned up, and the good
father was cleared, and little Daughter Dorothy was made glad. But this meagre
summary gives but a poor idea of the ins and outs of this charming story, and no
idea of the happy way in which it is told.&mdash;<i>Christian Register.</i></p></div>

<p><i>"Prince Vance" is an Entertaining Fairy Story of the wildest and most
fantastic adventures and of amusing and original impossibilities, which,
however, carry with them a stern puritan moral. This allegiance of unfettered
imagination and straightforward, wholesome, moral teaching is
unusual, and gives the little book a special value.</i></p>

<h2>FLIPWING, THE SPY.</h2>

<h3><span class="smcap">By</span> LILY F. <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'WESSELHOEFT'">WESSELH&OElig;FT</ins>,</h3>

</div>

<p>The story represents the action of certain animals, the characters of which are
depicted in accordance with their natures and the exigencies of the story. The object
is to cultivate the love of animal nature, which most children feel, and especially for
such creatures as bats, toads and others, which children are often improperly taught
to regard with disgust. The human characters introduced talk and act naturally, and
the book will be found very entertaining to young people.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The sketches of life, especially of its odd and out-of-the-way aspects, by H. H.
always possess so vivid a reality that they appear more like the actual scenes than
any copy by pencil or photograph. They form a series of living pictures, radiant
with sunlight and fresh as morning dew. In this new story the fruits of her fine
genius are of Colorado growth, and though without the antique flavor of her recollections
of Rome and Venice, are as delicious to the taste as they are tempting to
the eye, and afford a natural feast of exquisite quality."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"This charming little book, written for children's entertainment and instruction,
is equally delightful to the fathers and mothers. It is life in New England,
and the racy history of a long railway journey to the wilds of Colorado. The
children are neither imps nor angels, but just such children as are found in every
happy home. The pictures are so graphically drawn that we feel well acquainted
with Rob and Nelly, have travelled with them and climbed mountains and found
silver mines, and know all about the rude life made beautiful by a happy family,
and can say of Nelly, with their German neighbor, Mr. Kleesman, 'Ach well, she
haf better than any silver mine in her own self.'"&mdash;<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</i></p>

<p>"In 'Nelly's Silver Mine' Mrs. Helen Hunt Jackson has given us a true
classic for the nursery and the school-room, but its readers will not be confined to
any locality. Its vivid portraiture of Colorado life and its truth to child-nature
give it a charm which the most experienced cannot fail to feel. It will stand by
the side of Miss Edgeworth and Mrs. Barbauld in all the years to come."&mdash;<i>Mrs.
Caroline H. Dall.</i></p>

<p>"We heartily commend the book for its healthy spirit, its lively narrative, and
its freedom from most of the faults of books for children."&mdash;<i>Atlantic Monthly.</i></p></div>
